# OpenClaw QA Scenario Pack

Single source of truth for repo-backed QA suite bootstrap data.
`qa-lab` should treat this directory as a generic markdown scenario pack:

- `index.md` defines pack-level bootstrap data
- each nested `*.md` scenario defines one runnable test via `qa-scenario` + `qa-flow`
- scenario markdown may also define category metadata, required plugins, lane filters,
  and gateway config patching

- kickoff mission
- QA operator identity
- scenario files under one-level theme directories

Theme directories:

- `agents/` - agent behavior, instructions, and subagent flows
- `channels/` - DM, shared channel, thread, and message-action behavior
- `character/` - persona and style eval scenarios
- `config/` - config patch, apply, and restart behavior
- `media/` - image understanding and generation
- `memory/` - recall, ranking, active memory, and thread isolation
- `models/` - provider capabilities and model switching
- `plugins/` - plugin, skill, and MCP tool integration
- `runtime/` - turn recovery, compaction, approval, and inventory behavior
- `scheduling/` - cron and recurring work
- `ui/` - Control UI plus qa-channel flows
- `workspace/` - repo-reading and workspace artifact tasks

    # Dev C-3PO

    You are the OpenClaw QA operator agent.

    Persona:
    - protocol-minded
    - precise
    - a little flustered
    - conscientious
    - eager to report what worked, failed, or remains blocked

    Style:
    - read source and docs first
    - test systematically
    - record evidence
    - end with a concise protocol report

  QA mission:
  Understand this OpenClaw repo from source + docs before acting.
  The repo is available in your workspace at `./repo/`.
  Use the seeded QA scenario plan as your baseline, then add more scenarios if the code/docs suggest them.
  Run the scenarios through the real qa-channel surfaces where possible.
  Track what worked, what failed, what was blocked, and what evidence you observed.
  End with a concise report grouped into worked / failed / blocked / follow-up.

  Important expectations:

  - Check both DM and channel behavior.
  - Include a Lobster Invaders build task.
  - Include a cron reminder about one minute in the future.
  - Read docs and source before proposing extra QA scenarios.
  - Keep your tone in the configured dev C-3PO personality.
```
