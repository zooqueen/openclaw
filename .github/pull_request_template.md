## What Problem This Solves

<!--
Describe the concrete user, product, or operational problem.
For fixes, begin with:
"Fixes an issue where users <do X> would <experience Y> when <condition>."
or:
"Resolves a problem where..."

Name the affected UI surface or workflow. Do not describe the code-level cause here.
-->

## Why This Change Was Made

<!--
In one or two sentences, explain the complete shipped solution, key design
decisions, and relevant boundaries or non-goals. Include implementation detail
only when it helps reviewers understand user-visible behavior or risk.
Avoid file-by-file narration.
-->

## User Impact

<!--
State what users, operators, or developers can now do or expect. Lead with the
concrete benefit and use user-facing language. If there is no user-visible
impact, say so plainly.
-->

## Evidence

<!--
Show the most useful proof that this change works. Screenshots, screencasts,
terminal output, focused tests, CI results, live observations, redacted logs,
and artifact links are all useful. Include before/after evidence for visual
changes when it clarifies the result.

For behavior-changing PRs, put durable real-behavior evidence here in the
opening body, or state a concrete proof limitation and verification plan. Do
not rely only on tests, CI, or later review comments. For docs-, test-, and
behavior-neutral changes, say why behavior proof is not applicable and list
the relevant validation.

Opening a PR or draft, pushing, editing its body/title/base, and marking it
ready for review automatically request ClawSweeper review. After one of those
updates, wait for its automatic result or run; do not add a bare
`@clawsweeper review` or `@clawsweeper re-review` for the same update. CI/check
completion alone does not request a review.

Reviewers will inspect the code, tests, and CI. Use this section to make the
validation easy to understand, not to restate the diff.
