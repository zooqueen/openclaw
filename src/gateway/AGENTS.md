# Gateway Hot Paths

Gateway server tests and startup paths should not materialize bundled plugin
runtime when they only need plugin-owned static descriptors.

## Guardrails

- For plugin-owned Gateway behavior such as auth-bypass paths, prefer a
  lightweight public artifact resolver before falling back to the full channel
  plugin.
- Keep the full plugin contract and the lightweight artifact backed by the same
  plugin-owned helper so behavior does not diverge.
- Do not load broad bundled channel registries from Gateway HTTP/server code
  just to answer static questions.
- If adding a new plugin-owned Gateway descriptor, add the core resolver,
  plugin artifact, and mirrored full-plugin export in the same change.

## Verification

- Benchmark the affected Gateway test file before/after with
  `pnpm test <file>`.
- Run `pnpm build` when changing Gateway lazy-loading or bundled plugin
  artifacts.
