# OpenClaw PR Maintainer

Use this skill for maintainer-facing GitHub workflow, not for ordinary code changes.

## Start issue and PR triage with gitcrawl

- Use `$gitcrawl` first anytime you inspect OpenClaw issues or PRs.
- Check local `gitcrawl` data first for related threads, duplicate attempts, and already-landed fixes.
- Use `gitcrawl` for candidate discovery and clustering; use `gh`, `gh api`, and the current checkout to verify live state before commenting, labeling, closing, or landing.
- If `gitcrawl` is missing, stale, lacks the target thread, or has no embeddings for neighbor/search commands, fall back to the GitHub search workflow below.
- Do not run expensive/update commands such as `gitcrawl sync --include-comments`, future enrichment commands, or broad reclustering unless the user asked to update the local store or stale data is blocking the decision.

Common read-only path:

```bash
gitcrawl threads openclaw/openclaw --numbers <issue-or-pr-number> --include-closed --json
gitcrawl neighbors openclaw/openclaw --number <issue-or-pr-number> --limit 12 --json
gitcrawl search openclaw/openclaw --query "<scope or title keywords>" --mode hybrid --json
gitcrawl cluster-detail openclaw/openclaw --id <cluster-id> --member-limit 20 --body-chars 280 --json
```

## Surface opener identity

- For every reviewed, triaged, closed, or landed issue/PR, show the opener's human name when available, GitHub login, and account age.
- Get the login from `gh issue view` / `gh pr view` (`author.login`), then fetch profile metadata once with `gh api users/<login> --jq '{login,name,created_at,type}'`.
- Report account age as created date plus rough age, for example `Opened by Jane Doe (@jane, account created 2021-04-03, ~5y old)`.
- Also show recent GitHub activity when it informs maintainer risk: OpenClaw PRs, issues, and commits in the last 12 months; for linked issue-fixing PRs, include both the PR author and issue opener when they differ.
- Prefer the bundled helper for activity lookups:

```bash
.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/scripts/github-activity.sh <login> [other-login...]
.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/scripts/github-activity.sh --global <login>
```

- The helper reports repo-local activity first and can fetch public GitHub contribution totals for the same window with `--global`.
- Report activity compactly, for example `OpenClaw last 12mo: 4 PRs, 2 issues, 11 commits; GitHub public last 12mo: 86 commits, 9 PRs, 3 issues, 12 reviews`.
- If `name` is empty, use the login only. If profile lookup is rate-limited or unavailable, say `account age unknown` rather than omitting the opener.
- Use identity and activity as triage signal, not proof by itself: new, low-activity, or bot-like accounts can raise review caution, but code, repro, and CI evidence still decide.

## Apply close and triage labels correctly

- If an issue or PR matches an auto-close reason, apply the label and let `.github/workflows/auto-response.yml` handle the comment/close/lock flow.
- Do not manually close plus manually comment for these reasons.
- If an issue/PR is already fixed on current `main` or solved by a new release, comment with proof plus the canonical commit/PR/release, then close it.
- `r:*` labels can be used on both issues and PRs.
- Current reasons:
  - `r: skill`
  - `r: support`
  - `r: no-ci-pr`
  - `r: too-many-prs`
  - `r: testflight`
  - `r: third-party-extension`
  - `r: moltbook`
  - `r: spam`
  - `invalid`
  - `dirty` for PRs only

## Select small high-confidence triage candidates

When asked for `X` issues or PRs to triage, `X` means qualified candidates, not sampled threads.

Triage is read/prove/patch-local by default. Do not commit unless Peter writes
`commit` in the current instruction for the exact diff being handled. Do not
treat earlier messages, inferred intent, "next", sweep momentum, or bundled
publish language as commit permission. If Peter asks for follow-up work without
saying `commit`, keep the files dirty after local fixes and proof.

Only list candidates that pass all gates:

- small owner/surface, with a likely narrow fix and focused regression test
- symptom is reproducible or provable with logs, failing test, live command, dependency contract, or current-main behavior
- root cause is traceable to code with file/line and the proposed fix touches that path
- no strong smell that a broader refactor, ownership rethink, migration, or product decision is the better fix
- dependency-backed behavior checked against upstream docs/source/types; live or web proof used when local proof is insufficient

Loop:

1. Use `gitcrawl` / `gh` to gather candidate clusters.
2. Read issue/PR body, comments, current code, adjacent tests, and dependency contracts.
3. Try focused repro or proof.
4. Reject unclear, stale, speculative, broad-refactor, or owner-ambiguous items.
5. Continue until `X` qualified candidates or the bounded search is exhausted.

Output only qualifying candidates, with: ref, surface, proof, cause, fix sketch, why small, expected test/gate. If none qualify, say so; do not pad.

## Enforce the bug-fix evidence bar

- Never merge a bug-fix PR based only on issue text, PR text, or AI rationale.
- Before landing, require:
  1. symptom evidence such as a repro, logs, or a failing test
  2. a verified root cause in code with file/line
  3. a fix that touches the implicated code path
  4. a regression test when feasible, or explicit manual verification plus a reason no test was added
- If the claim is unsubstantiated or likely wrong, request evidence or changes instead of merging.
- If the linked issue appears outdated or incorrect, correct triage first. Do not merge a speculative fix.

## Close low-signal manual PRs carefully

- Do not close for red CI alone. Require a clear low-signal category plus stale or failed validation.
- Good manual-close categories:
  - blank or mostly untouched PR template with no concrete OpenClaw problem/fix
  - random docs-only churn such as root README translations, generic wording tweaks, or community-plugin discoverability docs that should go through ClawHub
  - test-only coverage without a linked bug, owner request, or behavior change
  - refactor-only cleanup, variable renames, formatting, or generated/baseline churn without maintainer request
  - third-party channel/provider/tool/skill/plugin work that belongs on ClawHub instead of core
  - risky ops/infra drive-bys such as new external CI services, release workflows, host upgrade scripts, Docker base migrations, or apt retry/fix-missing tweaks without owner request and green validation
  - dirty branches where a narrow stated change includes unrelated docs/generated/runtime/extension files
  - repeated bot-review spam or copied bot output without author-owned fixes
- Keep or escalate plausible focused bug fixes, green PRs, active maintainer discussions, assigned work, recent author follow-up, and unique reproduction details.
- For third-party capabilities, prefer the `r: third-party-extension` auto-response label when it applies; it points contributors to publish on ClawHub.

## Handle GitHub text safely

- For issue comments and PR comments, use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` for real newlines. Never embed `\n`.
- Do not use `gh issue/pr comment -b "..."` when the body contains backticks or shell characters. Prefer a single-quoted heredoc.
- Do not wrap issue or PR refs like `#24643` in backticks when you want auto-linking.
- PR landing comments should include clickable full commit links for landed and source SHAs when present.

## Search broadly before deciding

- Prefer `gitcrawl` first. Then use targeted GitHub keyword search to verify gaps, live status, comments, and candidates not present in the local store.
- Use `--repo openclaw/openclaw` with `--match title,body` first when using `gh search`.
- Add `--match comments` when triaging follow-up discussion or closed-as-duplicate chains.
- Do not stop at the first 500 results when the task requires a full search.

Examples:

```bash
gh search prs --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 -- "auto-update"
gh search issues --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 -- "auto-update"
gh search issues --repo openclaw/openclaw --match title,body --limit 50 \
  --json number,title,state,url,updatedAt -- "auto update" \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number) | \(.state) | \(.title) | \(.url)"'
```

## Follow PR review and landing hygiene

- If bot review conversations exist on your PR, address them and resolve them yourself once fixed.
- Leave a review conversation unresolved only when reviewer or maintainer judgment is still needed.
- When landing or merging any PR, follow the global `/landpr` process.
- Use `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>` for scoped commits instead of manual `git add` and `git commit`.
- Keep commit messages concise and action-oriented.
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` for PR submissions and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for issues.
- Do not commit PR-only artifacts such as screenshots under `.github/pr-assets`; attach them to the PR/comment or use an external artifact store instead.

## Extra safety

- If a close or reopen action would affect more than 5 PRs, ask for explicit confirmation with the exact count and target query first.
- `sync` means: if the tree is dirty, commit all changes with a sensible Conventional Commit message, then `git pull --rebase`, then `git push`. Stop if rebase conflicts cannot be resolved safely.
