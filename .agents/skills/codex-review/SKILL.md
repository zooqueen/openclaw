# Codex Review

Run Codex's built-in code review as a closeout check. This is code review (`codex review`), not Guardian `auto_review` approval routing.

Use when:
- user asks for Codex review / autoreview / second-model review
- after non-trivial code edits, before final/commit/ship
- reviewing a local branch or PR branch after fixes

## Contract

- Treat review output as advisory. Never blindly apply it.
- Verify every finding by reading the real code path and adjacent files.
- Read dependency docs/source/types when the finding depends on external behavior.
- Reject unrealistic edge cases, speculative risks, broad rewrites, and fixes that over-complicate the codebase.
- Prefer small fixes at the right ownership boundary; no refactor unless it clearly improves the bug class.
- If a review-triggered fix changes code, rerun focused tests and rerun Codex review once.
- Do not push just to review. Push only when the user requested push/ship/PR update.

## Pick Target

Dirty local work:

```bash
codex review --uncommitted
```

Branch/PR work:

```bash
git fetch origin
codex review --base origin/main
```

If an open PR exists, use its actual base:

```bash
base=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)
codex review --base "origin/$base"
```

Committed single change:

```bash
codex review --commit HEAD
```

## Parallel Closeout

Format first if formatting can change line locations. Then it is OK to run tests and review in parallel:

```bash
scripts/codex-review --parallel-tests "<focused test command>"
```

Tradeoff: tests may force code changes that stale the review. If tests or review lead to code edits, rerun the affected tests and rerun review once.

## Context Efficiency

Codex review is usually noisy. Default to a subagent filter when subagents are available. Ask it to run the review and return only:
- actionable findings it accepts
- findings it rejects, with one-line reason
- exact files/tests to rerun

Run inline only for tiny changes or when subagents are unavailable.

## Helper

Bundled helper:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/codex-review/scripts/codex-review --help
```

If installed from `agent-scripts`, path is:

```bash
/Users/steipete/Projects/agent-scripts/skills/codex-review/scripts/codex-review --help
```

The helper:
- chooses dirty `--uncommitted` first
- otherwise uses current PR base if `gh pr view` works
- otherwise uses `origin/main` for non-main branches
- writes only to stdout unless `--output` or `CODEX_REVIEW_OUTPUT` is set
- supports `--dry-run` and `--parallel-tests`

## Final Report

Include:
- review command used
- tests/proof run
- findings accepted/rejected, briefly why
- whether review was rerun after review-triggered edits
