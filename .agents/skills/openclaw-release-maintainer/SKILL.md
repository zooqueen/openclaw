# OpenClaw Release Maintainer

Use this skill for release and publish-time workflow. Keep ordinary development changes and GHSA-specific advisory work outside this skill.

## Respect release guardrails

- Do not change version numbers without explicit operator approval.
- Ask permission before any npm publish or release step.
- This skill should be sufficient to drive the normal release flow end-to-end.
- Use the private maintainer release docs for credentials, recovery steps, and mac signing/notary specifics, and use `docs/reference/RELEASING.md` for public policy.
- Core `openclaw` publish is manual `workflow_dispatch`; creating or pushing a tag does not publish by itself.
- Normal release work happens on a branch cut from `main`, not directly on
  `main`. Use `release/YYYY.M.D` for the branch name.
- If the operator asks for a release without saying stable/full, default to
  beta only. Continue from beta to stable only when the operator explicitly asks
  for the full release or an automated beta-and-stable train.
- Before release branching, pull latest `main` and confirm current `main` CI is
  green. Then branch from that commit so regular development can continue on
  `main` while release validation runs.
- Do not delete or rewrite beta tags after they leave the machine. If a
  published or pushed beta needs a fix, commit the fix on the release branch and
  increment to the next `-beta.N`.
- Use `/changelog` before version/tag preparation so the top changelog section
  is deduped and ordered by user impact.
- When any beta or stable release is live, make a best-effort Discord
  announcement using Peter's bot token from `.profile`; do not block or roll
  back the release if the announcement fails.

## Keep release channel naming aligned

- `stable`: tagged releases only, published to npm `beta` by default; operators may target npm `latest` explicitly or promote later
- `beta`: prerelease tags like `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`, with npm dist-tag `beta`
- Prefer `-beta.N`; do not mint new `-1` or `-2` beta suffixes
- `dev`: moving head on `main`
- When using a beta Git tag, publish npm with the matching beta version suffix so the plain version is not consumed or blocked

## Handle versions and release files consistently

- Version locations include:
  - `package.json`
  - `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts`
  - `apps/ios/Sources/Info.plist`
  - `apps/ios/Tests/Info.plist`
  - `apps/macos/Sources/OpenClaw/Resources/Info.plist`
  - `docs/install/updating.md`
  - Peekaboo Xcode project and plist version fields
- Before creating a release tag, make every version location above match the version encoded by that tag.
- For fallback correction tags like `vYYYY.M.D-N`, the repo version locations still stay at `YYYY.M.D`.
- “Bump version everywhere” means all version locations above except `appcast.xml`.
- Release signing and notary credentials live outside the repo in the private maintainer docs.
- Every stable OpenClaw release ships the npm package and macOS app together.
  Beta releases normally ship npm/package artifacts first and skip mac app
  build/sign/notarize unless the operator requests mac beta validation.
- The production Sparkle feed lives at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/appcast.xml`, and the canonical published file is `appcast.xml` on `main` in the `openclaw` repo.
- That shared production Sparkle feed is stable-only. Beta mac releases may
  upload assets to the GitHub prerelease, but they must not replace the shared
  `appcast.xml` unless a separate beta feed exists.
- For fallback correction tags like `vYYYY.M.D-N`, the repo version still stays
  at `YYYY.M.D`, but the mac release must use a strictly higher numeric
  `APP_BUILD` / Sparkle build than the original release so existing installs
  see it as newer.

## Build changelog-backed release notes

- Changelog entries should be user-facing, not internal release-process notes.
- When cutting a mac release with a beta GitHub prerelease:
  - tag `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N` from the release commit
  - create a prerelease titled `openclaw YYYY.M.D-beta.N`
  - use release notes from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` version section
  - attach at least the zip and dSYM zip, plus dmg if available
- Keep the top version entries in `CHANGELOG.md` sorted by impact:
  - `### Changes` first
  - `### Fixes` deduped with user-facing fixes first

## Run publish-time validation

Before tagging or publishing, run:

```bash
pnpm check:architecture
pnpm build
pnpm ui:build
pnpm release:check
pnpm test:install:smoke
```

For a non-root smoke path:

```bash
  OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_SKIP_NONROOT=1 pnpm test:install:smoke
```

After npm publish, run:

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts <published-version>
```

- This verifies the published registry install path in a fresh temp prefix.
- For stable correction releases like `YYYY.M.D-N`, it also verifies the
  upgrade path from `YYYY.M.D` to `YYYY.M.D-N` so a correction publish cannot
  silently leave existing global installs on the old base stable payload.
- Treat install smoke as a pack-budget gate too. `pnpm test:install:smoke`
  now fails the candidate update tarball when npm reports an oversized
  `unpackedSize`, so release-time e2e cannot miss pack bloat that would risk
  low-memory install/startup failures.
- Keep direct npm global coverage enabled in install smoke. It exercises plain
  `npm install -g <candidate>` fresh installs and npm-driven update installs,
  because many users install with npm even when docs prefer pnpm.
- Use `pnpm test:live:media video` for bounded video-provider smoke when video
  generation is in release scope. The default video smoke skips `fal`, runs one
  text-to-video attempt per provider with a one-second lobster prompt, and caps
  each provider operation with `OPENCLAW_LIVE_VIDEO_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`
  (`180000` by default).
- Run `pnpm test:live:media video --video-providers fal` only when FAL-specific
  proof is required. Its queue latency can dominate release time.
- Set `OPENCLAW_LIVE_VIDEO_GENERATION_FULL_MODES=1` only when intentionally
  validating the slower image-to-video and video-to-video transform lanes.

## Check all relevant release builds

- Always validate the OpenClaw npm release path before creating the tag.
- Default release checks:
  - `pnpm check`
  - `pnpm check:architecture`
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm ui:build`
  - `pnpm release:check`
  - `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_SKIP_NONROOT=1 pnpm test:install:smoke`
- Check all release-related build surfaces touched by the release, not only the npm package.
- For beta-style full e2e batteries, hard-cap top-level long lanes instead of letting them run indefinitely. Use host `timeout --foreground`/`gtimeout --foreground` caps such as:
  - `45m` for `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_SKIP_NONROOT=1 pnpm test:install:smoke`
  - `90m` for `pnpm test:docker:all`
  - Parallels caps from the `openclaw-parallels-smoke` skill
    If a lane hits its cap, stop and inspect/fix the affected lane before continuing; do not continue to wait on the same process.
- Actual npm install/update phases are capped at 5 minutes. If `npm install -g`, installer package install, or `openclaw update` takes longer than 300s in release e2e, stop treating the run as healthy progress and debug the installer/updater or harness.
- Serialize host build/package mutations ahead of VM lanes. Finish `pnpm build`, `pnpm ui:build`, `pnpm release:check`, install smoke, and any Docker/package-prep lanes before starting Parallels `npm pack` lanes; otherwise `dist` can disappear during VM pack prep and produce false failures.
- Include mac release readiness in preflight by running the public validation
  workflow in `openclaw/openclaw` and the real mac preflight in
  `openclaw/releases-private` for every release.
- Treat the `appcast.xml` update on `main` as part of mac release readiness, not an optional follow-up.
- The workflows remain tag-based. The agent is responsible for making sure
  preflight runs complete successfully before any publish run starts.
- Any fix after preflight means a new commit. Delete and recreate the tag and
  matching GitHub release from the fixed commit, then rerun preflight from
  scratch before publishing.
  Exception: never delete or recreate a beta tag that has already been pushed or
  published; increment to the next beta number instead.
- For stable mac releases, generate the signed `appcast.xml` before uploading
  public release assets so the updater feed cannot lag the published binaries.
- Serialize stable appcast-producing runs across tags so two releases do not
  generate replacement `appcast.xml` files from the same stale seed.
- For stable releases, confirm the latest beta already passed the broader release workflows before cutting stable.
- If any required build, packaging step, or release workflow is red, do not say the release is ready.

## Use the right auth flow

- OpenClaw publish uses GitHub trusted publishing.
- Stable npm promotion from `beta` to `latest` uses the private
  `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-dist-tags.yml`
  workflow because `npm dist-tag` management needs `NPM_TOKEN`, while the
  public npm release workflow stays OIDC-only.
- Direct stable publishes can also use that private dist-tag workflow to point
  `beta` at the already-published `latest` version when the operator wants both
  tags aligned immediately.
- The publish run must be started manually with `workflow_dispatch`.
- The npm workflow and the private mac publish workflow accept
  `preflight_only=true` to run validation/build/package steps without uploading
  public release assets.
- Real npm publish requires a prior successful npm preflight run id so the
  publish job promotes the prepared tarball instead of rebuilding it.
- Real private mac publish requires a prior successful private mac preflight
  run id so the publish job promotes the prepared artifacts instead of
  rebuilding or renotarizing them again.
- The private mac workflow also accepts `smoke_test_only=true` for branch-safe
  workflow smoke tests that use ad-hoc signing, skip notarization, skip shared
  appcast generation, and do not prove release readiness.
- `preflight_only=true` on the npm workflow is also the right way to validate an
  existing tag after publish; it should keep running the build checks even when
  the npm version is already published.
- npm validation-only preflight may still be dispatched from ordinary branches
  when testing workflow changes before merge. Release checks and real publish
  use only `main` or `release/YYYY.M.D`.
- `.github/workflows/macos-release.yml` in `openclaw/openclaw` is now a
  public validation-only handoff. It validates the tag/release state and points
  operators to the private repo. It still rebuilds the JS outputs needed for
  release validation, but it does not sign, notarize, or publish macOS
  artifacts.
- `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-validate.yml`
  is the required private mac validation lane for `swift test`; keep it green
  before any real stable mac publish run starts.
- Real mac preflight and real mac publish both use
  `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-publish.yml`.
- The private mac validation lane runs on GitHub's standard macOS runner.
- The private mac preflight path runs on GitHub's xlarge macOS runner and uses
  a SwiftPM cache because the build/sign/notarize/package path is CPU-heavy.
- Private mac preflight uploads notarized build artifacts as workflow artifacts
  instead of uploading public GitHub release assets.
- Private smoke-test runs upload ad-hoc, non-notarized build artifacts as
  workflow artifacts and intentionally skip stable `appcast.xml` generation.
- For stable releases, npm preflight, public mac validation, private mac
  validation, and private mac preflight must all pass before any real publish
  run starts. For beta releases, npm preflight plus the selected Docker,
  install/update, Parallels, and release-check lanes are sufficient unless mac
  beta validation was explicitly requested.
- Real publish runs may be dispatched from `main` or from a
  `release/YYYY.M.D` branch. For release-branch runs, the tag must be contained
  in that release branch, and the real publish must reuse a successful preflight
  from the same branch.
- The release workflows stay tag-based; rely on the documented release sequence
  rather than workflow-level SHA pinning.
- The `npm-release` environment must be approved by `@openclaw/openclaw-release-managers` before publish continues.
- Mac publish uses
  `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-publish.yml` for
  private mac preflight artifact preparation and real publish artifact
  promotion.
- Real private mac publish uploads the packaged `.zip`, `.dmg`, and
  `.dSYM.zip` assets to the existing GitHub release in `openclaw/openclaw`
  automatically when `OPENCLAW_PUBLIC_REPO_RELEASE_TOKEN` is present in the
  private repo `mac-release` environment.
- For stable releases, the agent must also download the signed
  `macos-appcast-<tag>` artifact from the successful private mac workflow and
  then update `appcast.xml` on `main`.
- For beta mac releases, do not update the shared production `appcast.xml`
  unless a separate beta Sparkle feed exists.
- The private repo targets a dedicated `mac-release` environment. If the GitHub
  plan does not yet support required reviewers there, do not assume the
  environment alone is the approval boundary; rely on private repo access and
  CODEOWNERS until those settings can be enabled.
- Do not use `NPM_TOKEN` or the plugin OTP flow for the OpenClaw package
  publish path; package publishing uses trusted publishing.
- Use `NPM_TOKEN` only for explicit npm dist-tag management modes, because npm
  does not support trusted publishing for `npm dist-tag add`.
- `@openclaw/*` plugin publishes use a separate maintainer-only flow.
- Only publish plugins that already exist on npm; bundled disk-tree-only plugins stay unpublished.

## Fallback local mac publish

- Keep the original local macOS publish workflow available as a fallback in case
  CI/CD mac publishing is unavailable or broken.
- Preserve the existing maintainer workflow Peter uses: run it on a real Mac
  with local signing, notary, and Sparkle credentials already configured.
- Follow the private maintainer macOS runbook for the local steps:
  `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh` to build, sign, notarize, and package the app;
  manual GitHub release asset upload; then `scripts/make_appcast.sh` plus the
  `appcast.xml` commit to `main`.
- `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh` now fails closed for release builds if the
  bundled app comes out with a debug bundle id, an empty Sparkle feed URL, or a
  `CFBundleVersion` below the canonical Sparkle build floor for that short
  version. For correction tags, set a higher explicit `APP_BUILD`.
- `scripts/make_appcast.sh` first uses `generate_appcast` from `PATH`, then
  falls back to the SwiftPM Sparkle tool output under `apps/macos/.build`.
- For stable tags, the local fallback may update the shared production
  `appcast.xml`.
- For beta tags, the local fallback still publishes the mac assets but must not
  update the shared production `appcast.xml` unless a separate beta feed exists.
- Treat the local workflow as fallback only. Prefer the CI/CD publish workflow
  when it is working.
- After any stable mac publish, verify all of the following before you call the
  release finished:
  - the GitHub release has `.zip`, `.dmg`, and `.dSYM.zip` assets
  - `appcast.xml` on `main` points at the new stable zip
  - the packaged app reports the expected short version and a numeric
    `CFBundleVersion` at or above the canonical Sparkle build floor

## Run the release sequence

1. Confirm the operator explicitly wants to cut a release.
2. Choose the exact target version and git tag.
3. Pull latest `main`, confirm `main` CI is green, and create
   `release/YYYY.M.D` from that commit.
4. Run `/changelog` for the target version, then make every repo version
   location match that tag before creating it.
5. Commit release preparation changes on the release branch and push the branch.
6. Run the full preflight for all relevant release builds from the release
   branch, including release checks, Docker install/update, and Parallels
   install/update.
7. For beta releases, skip mac app build/sign/notarize unless beta scope or a
   release blocker specifically requires it. For stable releases, include the
   mac app, signing, notarization, and appcast path.
8. Confirm the target npm version is not already published.
9. Create and push the git tag from the release branch.
10. Create or refresh the matching GitHub release.
11. Start `.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-release.yml` from the release branch
    with `preflight_only=true`
    and choose the intended `npm_dist_tag` (`beta` default; `latest` only for
    an intentional direct stable publish). Wait for it to pass. Save that run id
    because the real publish requires it to reuse the prepared npm tarball.
12. For stable releases, start `.github/workflows/macos-release.yml` in
    `openclaw/openclaw` and wait for the public validation-only run to pass.
13. For stable releases, start
    `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-validate.yml`
    with the same tag and wait for the private mac validation lane to pass.
14. For stable releases, start
    `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-publish.yml`
    with `preflight_only=true` and wait for it to pass. Save that run id because
    the real publish requires it to reuse the notarized mac artifacts.
15. If any preflight or validation run fails, fix the issue on a new commit,
    delete the tag and matching GitHub release, recreate them from the fixed
    commit, and rerun all relevant preflights from scratch before continuing.
    Never reuse old preflight results after the commit changes. For pushed or
    published beta tags, do not delete/recreate; increment to the next beta tag.
16. Start `.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-release.yml` from the same branch with
    the same tag for the real publish, choose `npm_dist_tag` (`beta` default,
    `latest` only when you intentionally want direct stable publish), keep it
    the same as the preflight run, and pass the successful npm
    `preflight_run_id`.
17. Wait for `npm-release` approval from `@openclaw/openclaw-release-managers`.
18. Run postpublish verification:
    `node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts <published-version>`.
19. Announce the beta/stable release on Discord best-effort using Peter's bot
    token from `.profile`.
20. If the operator requested beta only, stop after beta verification and the
    announcement.
21. If the stable release was published to `beta`, start the private
    `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-dist-tags.yml`
    workflow after beta validation passes to promote that stable version from
    `beta` to `latest`, then verify `latest` now points at that version.
22. If the stable release was published directly to `latest` and `beta` should
    follow it, start that same private dist-tag workflow to point `beta` at the
    stable version, then verify both `latest` and `beta` point at that version.
23. For stable releases, start
    `openclaw/releases-private/.github/workflows/openclaw-macos-publish.yml`
    for the real publish with the successful private mac `preflight_run_id` and
    wait for success.
24. Verify the successful real private mac run uploaded the `.zip`, `.dmg`,
    and `.dSYM.zip` artifacts to the existing GitHub release in
    `openclaw/openclaw`.
25. For stable releases, download `macos-appcast-<tag>` from the successful
    private mac run, update `appcast.xml` on `main`, and verify the feed. Merge
    or cherry-pick release branch changes back to `main` after stable succeeds.
26. For beta releases, publish the mac assets only when intentionally requested;
    expect no shared production
    `appcast.xml` artifact and do not update the shared production feed unless a
    separate beta feed exists.
27. After publish, verify npm and the attached release artifacts.
