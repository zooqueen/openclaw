# Control UI Guide

This directory owns Control UI-specific guidance that should not live in the repo root.

## i18n Rules

- Foreign-language locale bundles in `ui/src/i18n/locales/*.ts` are generated output.
- Do not hand-edit non-English locale bundles or `ui/src/i18n/.i18n/*` unless a targeted generated-output fix is explicitly requested.
- The source of truth is `ui/src/i18n/locales/en.ts` plus the generator/runtime wiring in:
  - `scripts/control-ui-i18n.ts`
  - `ui/src/i18n/lib/types.ts`
  - `ui/src/i18n/lib/registry.ts`
- Contributor flow: update English strings and locale wiring, run keyless `pnpm ui:i18n:baseline`, and commit `en.ts` plus changed baseline files. The command records intentional runtime fallbacks without rewriting foreign-language bundles.
- Rebase/merge conflicts: resolve and stage source conflicts first, then run `pnpm ui:i18n:resolve-conflicts`. It combines translation-memory entries from both sides, regenerates every derived artifact, runs the strict check, and stages the generated result. Provider auth is required when the resolved keys are not already cached. Never hand-merge generated locale files.
- `pnpm ui:i18n:verify` is deterministic and keyless. `pnpm lint` and the changed-check UI lane run it. It validates catalog shape, English-key coverage or explicit fallback listing, orphan keys, placeholder parity, canonical ordering, runtime locale wiring, and raw-copy baseline drift.
- Translation flow: the `control-ui-locale-refresh` workflow translates after merge and opens a generated PR. `pnpm ui:i18n:sync` remains the authenticated maintainer path; do not run it without provider auth when new keys exist. `pnpm ui:i18n:check` is the strict generated-output/release gate.
- Prioritization report: `pnpm ui:i18n:report [--surface <name>] [--locale <locale>] [--top <n>]` shows current hardcoded-copy focus areas and locale fallback metadata. It is not a drift gate; use `pnpm ui:i18n:check` for that.
- If locale outputs drift, regenerate them. Do not manually translate or hand-maintain generated locale files by default.

## Scope

- Keep UI-specific rules here.
- Leave repo-global architecture, verification, and git workflow rules in the root `AGENTS.md`.
