// A native iMessage poll's comment/caption is delivered as a separate inbound
// message that is an INLINE REPLY to the poll balloon (its `reply_to_guid` is
// the poll's guid). Modern imsg emits balloon metadata, so the same-sender coalesce
// path deliberately flushes the poll and the reply separately — which means the
// caption reaches the agent as its own message. The agent then votes on the
// poll AND answers the caption in prose, a redundant restatement of the vote.
//
// This tracker lets the monitor fold the caption into the poll: the poll message
// already renders the options + vote cue, so a reply that arrives WITH the poll
// is dropped instead of delivered standalone.
//
// The caption is sent as part of composing the poll, so its timestamp is
// essentially the poll's. We only fold a reply whose own timestamp lands within
// a short window of the poll; a deliberate later inline reply to the poll (e.g.
// "I can't make it") falls outside the window and is delivered normally.

// The caption ships with the poll, so it lands within a couple seconds; a short
// window keeps genuine later replies out. Generous enough to absorb clock/queue
// skew, tight enough that a human's read-then-type reply falls outside.
