/**
 * Substrate-level redaction-sentinel guard.
 *
 * Closes the `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` corruption class by rejecting the
 * literal string at the emit boundary. Per-call-site reject rules
 * (added piecemeal in [#62281](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/62281),
 * [#44357](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/44357),
 * [#13495](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/13495), and others)
 * caught the symptom; this guard removes the substrate that produced
 * the symptom in the first place.
 *
 * Throwing at emit (not at the consumer) means every code path through
 * the substrate is covered, including future call sites we haven't
 * audited.
