 * about what a "valid" SOUL.md / AGENTS.md / MEMORY.md looks like; it
 * exposes the markdown features (frontmatter, sections, items, tables,
 * code blocks) that any `OcPath` (`{ file, section?, item?, field? }`) can
 * resolve over. Per-file lint opinions ride in @openclaw/oc-lint, not
 * here.
 *
 * **Byte-fidelity contract**: `emitMd(parse(raw)) === raw` for every input
 * the parser accepts. The parser preserves the original bytes on the
 * root node (`raw`) so emitters can round-trip even content the AST
 * doesn't structurally model (foreign content, idiosyncratic whitespace).
