# ClickClack OpenClaw channel

Official OpenClaw channel plugin for ClickClack.

## Install

```sh
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/clickclack
```

## Setup

```sh
openclaw channels add clickclack \
  --base-url https://clickclack.example.com \
  --token ccb_... \
  --workspace default
openclaw gateway
```

Run `openclaw onboard` for guided setup. The workspace value can be a
`wsp_...` id, slug, or display name.

For the default account only, `--use-env` reads `CLICKCLACK_BOT_TOKEN`; config
storage is the normal setup path.

## Command menus

ClickClack command menus are enabled by default. At gateway startup, the
extension publishes OpenClaw's native commands for composer autocomplete,
labeled with the bot's handle. The bot token must include `commands:write`;
current `bot:write` and `bot:admin` bundles include it.

Set `commandMenu: false` on an account to disable menu sync. Sync failures do
not prevent the gateway from starting, so older tokens and ClickClack servers
continue to work without a menu.

## Discussions

ClickClack can create one managed channel for each OpenClaw session:

The account token needs `channels:write`, which is included in `bot:admin` but
not in the normal `bot:write` setup token. The ClickClack server must also
support and return the managed-channel fields used by this integration.

```json5
{
  channels: {
    clickclack: {
      baseUrl: "https://clickclack.example.com",
      token: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "CLICKCLACK_BOT_TOKEN" },
      workspace: "default",
      discussions: {
        enabled: true,
        workspace: "default",
        controlUrlBase: "https://team.openclaw.ai",
        section: "Sessions",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Opening a session discussion creates a public, externally managed channel and
stores its binding in the ClickClack plugin's SQLite state. Session archive,
restore, label, category, and deletion changes are reflected in the channel;
deletion archives the channel and never deletes its messages. `workspace`
defaults to the account workspace, and `section` defaults to `Sessions`.
`controlUrlBase` adds a link back to `/chat?session=<session-key>` in the
OpenClaw Control UI.

Enable discussions on exactly one ClickClack account. Multiple enabled
discussion accounts are rejected because the session discussion provider does
not have an account selector.

Messages in the managed channel run in a stable side session under the same
agent id as the attached main session. The plugin installs a scoped host grant
for `sessions_history`, `session_status`, and `sessions_send` between that side
session and its attached main session, so `tools.sessions.visibility` can stay
at its safer default `tree`. A second host-side policy blocks session discovery
and alternate targets; the side-agent prompt is not the authorization boundary.
The agent still needs those three tools in its effective tool allowlist.

The binding, managed ownership reference, and side-session identity include the
concrete OpenClaw session id as well as the pinned server and channel. Resetting
a reusable session key, replacing a binding, or retargeting it therefore revokes
the old channel locally, archives it when the old credential remains usable, and
starts a fresh channel and side transcript.
Messages arriving through an archived, reset, disabled, or retargeted managed
binding are dropped instead of falling back to the account's normal channel
routing. Released bindings leave a durable revoked-channel marker so delayed
realtime events remain fail-closed. Remote ownership is keyed by ClickClack
server and channel id, so renaming the local account cannot turn a managed
channel into an ordinary one.

Managed-channel ownership references include a durable per-installation id, so
two OpenClaw gateways using the same ClickClack workspace do not adopt each
other's discussion channels. They also include the destination and a durable
binding generation, so an account or workspace round trip cannot re-adopt a
previous channel. Changing or removing `controlUrlBase` is reflected on the next
lifecycle reconciliation pass.

If a channel-create response is lost, the pending ownership reservation
temporarily quarantines otherwise-unbound events in that workspace. The same
coarse reconciler then adopts the created channel or clears/archives the
ambiguous attempt; a reset cannot make the old channel fall through to ordinary
routing.

When a workspace move keeps the original workspace credential configured, the
plugin archives the old channel before release. If the token is replaced with a
workspace-scoped credential that cannot access the old workspace, OpenClaw
releases the binding into the revoked-channel marker without trying the new token
against the old channel; archive that leftover channel from ClickClack.

The main session gets a read-only `discussion` tool that pulls the latest
channel messages, including recent thread replies. The pull uses bounded
history and thread-request budgets; its output says when older active threads
may have been omitted. It never posts, archives, renames, or otherwise mutates
the discussion.
