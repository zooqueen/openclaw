# OpenClaw Android Versioning

Android release builds use pinned app metadata instead of auto-bumping `build.gradle.kts`.

## Version model

- `apps/android/version.json` is the source of truth.
- `version` is the Play `versionName` and uses CalVer: `YYYY.M.D`.
- `versionCode` uses `YYYYMMDDNN`, where `NN` is a two-digit build number for that pinned app version.
- `apps/android/Config/Version.properties` is generated from `version.json` and read by Gradle.

Examples:

- `version = 2026.6.2`
- `versionCode = 2026060201`
- another upload on the same release train: `versionCode = 2026060202`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm android:version
pnpm android:version:check
pnpm android:version:sync
pnpm android:version:pin -- --from-gateway
pnpm android:version:pin -- --version 2026.6.5 --version-code 2026060501
```

## Release Workflow

1. Pin Android to the intended release version.
2. Run `pnpm android:version:sync`.
3. Update `apps/android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/release_notes.txt`.
4. Run `pnpm android:release:archive` to produce the signed Play AAB and third-party APK.
5. Run `pnpm android:release:upload` to upload metadata and the Play AAB to Google Play internal testing.
6. Promote to production manually in Google Play Console.

The third-party flavor is archived as a signed APK for non-Play distribution. It is not uploaded by the Play release lane.
