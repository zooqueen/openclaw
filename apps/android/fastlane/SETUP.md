# fastlane setup (OpenClaw Android)

Install:

```bash
brew install fastlane
```

Create a Google Play service account JSON key with Google Play Developer API access, then grant that service account access to the OpenClaw app in Play Console.

Recommended local auth:

```bash
GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY=/absolute/path/to/google-play-service-account.json
```

Optional app targeting:

```bash
GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE_NAME=ai.openclaw.app
```

Android release signing uses the same private `apps-signing` repository and `MATCH_PASSWORD` secret as iOS, but with Android-specific encrypted assets. Pull the shared upload key before release validation:

```bash
pnpm android:release:signing:plan
MATCH_PASSWORD=<signing repo password> pnpm android:release:signing:sync:pull
MATCH_PASSWORD=<signing repo password> pnpm android:release:signing:check
```

The pull command materializes decrypted signing files under `apps/android/build/release-signing/`, which is gitignored. Later Fastlane release commands reload those materialized values and export them to Gradle for the current process.

For the first setup or rotation, provide the Play upload keystore and a local signing properties file, then push encrypted assets to `apps-signing`:

```bash
MATCH_PASSWORD=<signing repo password> \
OPENCLAW_ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE=<path-to-upload-keystore.jks> \
OPENCLAW_ANDROID_SIGNING_PROPERTIES=<path-to-android-signing.properties> \
pnpm android:release:signing:sync:push
```

The source signing properties file must contain:

```properties
OPENCLAW_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD=<store-password>
OPENCLAW_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=<upload-key-alias>
OPENCLAW_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=<key-password>
```

Store the Google Play upload key, not the irreplaceable app signing key, when Play App Signing is enabled.

Validate auth:

```bash
cd apps/android
fastlane android auth_check
```

Archive locally without upload:

```bash
pnpm android:release:archive
```

This command is for local archive validation only. It is not a fallback upload
path after `pnpm android:release:upload` fails.

Generate deterministic Google Play screenshots:

```bash
pnpm android:screenshots
```

The script creates and boots a retained `OpenClaw_Screenshots_API36` AVD from
Android's no-cutout Pixel 2 profile when needed. The API 36 Google APIs system
image must be installed. Use `ANDROID_SCREENSHOT_AVD` or `--avd <name>` to
select another AVD, or `--device <adb-serial>` to explicitly capture from a
connected emulator.

Upload metadata, release notes, and the Play AAB to the configured Google Play track:

```bash
pnpm android:release:upload
```

Direct Fastlane entry point:

```bash
cd apps/android
fastlane android release_upload
```

Use the direct Fastlane entry point only for maintainer debugging when explicitly
requested. Agent-driven releases must use `pnpm android:release:upload` and stop
if it fails.

Release rules:

- `apps/android/version.json` is the pinned Android release version source.
- `apps/android/Config/Version.properties` is generated from that source and read by Gradle.
- `apps/android/CHANGELOG.md` is the Android-only changelog and release-note source.
- `apps/android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/release_notes.txt` is generated from that changelog by `pnpm android:version:sync`.
- `apps/android/Config/ReleaseSigning.json` pins the encrypted Android signing assets in the shared signing repo.
- `apkCertificateSha256` in that manifest pins the upload certificate accepted for standalone release APKs; rotate it only with the encrypted keystore.
- `MATCH_PASSWORD` enables Fastlane to pull encrypted Android signing assets into `apps/android/build/release-signing/` before release validation or archive builds.
- Supported pinned Android versions use CalVer: `YYYY.M.D`.
- `versionCode` uses `YYYYMMDDNN`, where `NN` is a two-digit build number for the pinned version.
- `pnpm android:version:pin -- --from-gateway` promotes the current root gateway version into the pinned Android release version.
- `pnpm android:version:pin -- --version 2026.6.5 --version-code 2026060502` increments another build on the same Android release train.
- `pnpm android:version:sync` updates generated version artifacts.
- `pnpm android:version:check` validates checked-in Android version artifacts.
- `pnpm android:release:preflight` validates Google Play auth, Android release signing, synced versioning, release notes, and prints the package/track/version/versionCode that will be uploaded.
- `pnpm android:release:signing:sync:pull` pulls encrypted Android signing assets from `apps-signing`.
- `pnpm android:release:signing:sync:push` creates or refreshes encrypted Android signing assets in `apps-signing`.
- `pnpm android:screenshots` builds and installs the Play debug app, launches deterministic screenshot scenes, and captures raw PNGs.
- `pnpm android:release:archive` builds the signed Play AAB and third-party APK into `apps/android/build/release-artifacts/`.
- `pnpm android:release:upload` uploads the Play AAB to the configured Google Play track. The default track is `internal`.
- Stable GitHub Release APK publication is separate from Google Play: `OpenClaw Release Publish` dispatches `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`, whose protected `android-release` environment provides `MATCH_PASSWORD`; the repository GitHub App reads the encrypted signing repo.
- Production promotion remains manual in Google Play Console.
- If `pnpm android:release:upload` fails, agent-driven releases must stop and report the failing step. Do not fall back to `pnpm android:release:archive`, `pnpm android:release:metadata`, direct Fastlane lanes, Gradle release artifacts plus Google Play upload commands, or mobile release ref recording.

Screenshots:

- Android screenshot capture writes raw Play screenshots under `apps/android/fastlane/metadata/android/<locale>/images/phoneScreenshots/`.
- Set `SUPPLY_UPLOAD_SCREENSHOTS=1` to include those screenshots in `fastlane android metadata`.
- Do not commit generated screenshot captures unless they become intentional store metadata assets.
