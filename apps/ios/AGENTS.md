# iOS Release Agent Policy

Root rules still apply. This file adds the iOS release guardrails.

## UI / Typography

- iOS SwiftUI text should use branded typography helpers, not bare system fonts. Use `OpenClawType` in `apps/ios/Sources/**`, `OpenClawChatTypography` in shared chat UI, `WatchClawType` in watch UI, and `OpenClawActivityType` in Live Activity UI.
- Apply branded fonts at the rendered text/control boundary when practical: `Text`, `Label`, `Button` labels, picker options, menu items, alert text/buttons, row titles/subtitles, placeholder overlays, chips, badges, and toolbar actions. Do not rely on distant parent `.font(...)` inheritance for user-visible text when a local modifier is cheap and clear.
- Avoid shorthand controls like `Button("Title")`, `Link("Title", ...)`, `TextField("Placeholder", ...)`, and `SecureField("Placeholder", ...)` when they make typography or placeholder styling implicit. Prefer explicit label builders with branded `Text`/`Label`.
- Secure-field placeholders need both branded visual styling and accessibility semantics. If using an overlay placeholder, keep the actual field semantically named with `.accessibilityLabel(...)` and hide the decorative placeholder from accessibility.
- System font modifiers are acceptable for SF Symbol `Image(systemName:)` sizing, not for user-visible text unless a platform control makes branded typography impossible. If an exception is intentional, keep it narrow and explain why.
- When touching iOS text surfaces, update/keep `apps/ios/Tests/OpenClawTypographyTests.swift` so bare text/control regressions are caught, then run the focused typography test.

## Licenses Screen

- Maintain the Settings-tab Licenses screen when iOS app dependencies change.
- Bundled license files live in `apps/ios/Resources/Licenses/`.
- License files must be UTF-8 `.txt` files. Do not add Markdown, HTML, RTF, or generated plist license content.
- The Licenses screen discovers bundled `.txt` files at runtime through `LicenseDocumentLoader`; do not hardcode individual license rows in Swift.
- License rows are ordered alphabetically in code by derived display title. Do not use numeric filename prefixes for ordering.
- Filenames should be plain dependency names, for example `WebRTC.txt`; the filename is used only to derive the row title and must not be shown as a row subtitle.
- Do not add OpenClaw, OpenClaw Foundation, or other first-party/self-owned license entries. The screen is for third-party/open-source dependency acknowledgements.
- When adding, removing, or upgrading iOS dependencies, audit whether `apps/ios/Resources/Licenses/` needs updates. Exclude dependencies owned by OpenClaw Foundation from the published license list.
- When adding, removing, or replacing redistributed font binaries under `apps/ios/Sources/Fonts/`, update `apps/ios/THIRD_PARTY_FONTS.md` with immutable upstream source URLs and SHA-256 checksums for each bundled file.
- Keep license detail bodies rendered as verbatim monospace text.
- Keep the Settings Licenses row at the bottom Settings section with no section title unless product direction changes.
- When changing license loading or presentation, update `apps/ios/Tests/LicenseDocumentLoaderTests.swift` and `apps/ios/Tests/SwiftUIRenderSmokeTests.swift`, then run focused iOS tests.

## App Store Releases

- Agent-driven App Store uploads must use only `pnpm ios:release:upload`.
- App Store uploads must include explicit release intent: `pnpm ios:release:upload -- --version <YYYY.M.D>` and `--build-number <n>` when a specific build has been chosen.
- If `pnpm ios:release:upload` exits non-zero, stop immediately and report the failing step.
- After a failed `pnpm ios:release:upload`, do not continue with `pnpm ios:release:archive`, `asc builds upload`, `asc release stage`, `asc publish appstore`, `asc review submit`, direct Fastlane lanes, or any manual App Store Connect mutation command.
- Do not submit an iOS App Store version for App Review. App Review submission stays manual unless the user explicitly asks to submit a specific already-prepared version after the failed state has been reported.
- `pnpm ios:release:archive` is for local archive validation only. It is not a fallback release path after screenshot, metadata, or upload-lane failure.
