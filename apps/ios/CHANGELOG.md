# OpenClaw iOS Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed Apple Watch connection setup so pairing and companion-install changes refresh immediately and cold launches wait for WatchConnectivity activation before sending.
- Redesigned the Settings About screen with the animated mascot, app tagline, and Website/Docs/GitHub/Discord links.
- Fixed startup aborts caused by inactive Voice Wake initializing the simulator audio pipeline.
- Debug builds now use separate app, extension, widget, and Watch identifiers plus a distinct debug icon, so they can remain installed beside release builds.
- Animated the OpenClaw mascot (float, blink, antenna wiggle, claw snaps) across onboarding, sidebar, and command center, matching openclaw.ai.
