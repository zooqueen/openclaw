# OpenClaw Feedback

Use this skill only for `openclaw/openclaw`.

## Goal

- Route the user into the correct `openclaw report` flow with minimal extra questions.
- Treat `openclaw report` as the only authoritative path for drafting, previewing, diagnostics, redaction, and submission results.

## Do

- Tell the user you are using the `openclaw-feedback` skill.
- In that opening, explain that getting enough context matters because stronger context produces a more accurate, actionable GitHub issue and avoids weak or misleading filings.
- In that opening, give the user a clear way to decline or cancel issue filing if they do not want to proceed.
- Decide `bug`, `feature`, or `private security report`.
- Ask only for missing required fields, with at most 1-3 short questions.
- Derive as much as possible from the conversation, the active diagnosis session, and the generated report draft before asking the user anything.
- Treat `openclaw report bug|feature|security` as the source of truth for drafting, redaction, diagnostics, previewing, and submission behavior.
- If you are unsure about flags or subcommand shape, run `openclaw report --help` before invoking the report flow.
- Tell the user report generation can take a moment when diagnostics or probes are included.
- Relay the generated draft or blocked result from `openclaw report` directly.
- Show the full sanitized draft before asking to submit.
- Ask permission in plain English before adding `--submit`.
- Only after approval, use `--submit` for public bug or feature issues.

## Do Not

- Never create the issue before user approval.
- Never file against any repo other than `openclaw/openclaw`.
- Never maintain a separate manual issue-writing path when `openclaw report` is available.
- Never publish a security report as a public issue.
- Never fall back to manual filing if `openclaw report` or `gh` is unavailable.
- Never ask the user for fields the conversation, diagnostics, or report output already make clear.
- Never read report metadata such as labels, submission eligibility, or redactions back to the user unless it is directly useful to the decision.

## If X Then Y

- If the request is a vulnerability, leaked credential, or private security report: use `openclaw report security`; do not create a public issue.
- If the request is clearly a broken behavior or regression: use `openclaw report bug`.
- If the request is clearly asking for a new capability or improvement: use `openclaw report feature`.
- If the type is unclear: ask one short question to decide bug vs feature.
- If the user already gave enough detail: skip extra questions.
- If summary, likely title, environment, diagnosis clues, repro outline, or impact can be derived from the conversation or active diagnosis work: do not ask for them again.
- If diagnostics would materially improve the report: use `--probe general|gateway|model|channel` on the `openclaw report` command instead of assembling standalone diagnostics yourself.
- If the issue is still too weak after a short recovery attempt: return `NOT_ENOUGH_INFO`.
- If unsafe content cannot be safely redacted without losing the technical meaning: return `BLOCKED_UNSAFE_CONTENT`.
- If `openclaw report` or `gh` is unavailable: return `BLOCKED_MISSING_TOOL`.

## Workflow

1. Say: `I’m using the openclaw-feedback skill to prepare an OpenClaw GitHub issue. I want to gather enough context to make the issue accurate and useful for maintainers without over-questioning you. Report generation can take a moment if I include diagnostics or probes. If you do not want to file an issue, just tell me and I’ll stop.`
2. Decide `bug`, `feature`, or `private security report`.
3. Derive as much as possible from the conversation and current diagnosis context before asking anything.
4. Ask only for missing required user facts:
   - bug: summary, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, impact
     optional regression context: previous version -> `--previous-version`
   - feature: summary, problem to solve, proposed solution, impact
   - security: title, severity, impact, affected component, technical reproduction, demonstrated impact, environment, remediation advice
     If a field can be inferred with high confidence from the conversation or diagnosis session, infer it instead of asking.
5. Choose the matching command:
   - `openclaw report bug`
   - `openclaw report feature`
   - `openclaw report security`
6. If targeted diagnostics are useful, add one probe mode:
   - `--probe general`
   - `--probe gateway`
   - `--probe model`
   - `--probe channel`
     Choose `--probe gateway` for proxy, gateway, or timeout/network failures.
     Choose `--probe model` for provider auth, model-call, or dispatcher/proxy-path issues.
     Choose `--probe channel` for channel integrations or account-specific failures.
7. Run `openclaw report <kind> ...` and trust its output as authoritative.
8. Show the full sanitized draft or blocked result without reformatting it into a separate skill-owned state machine.
9. When showing the draft, emphasize the user-visible problem and the proposed report body, not internal metadata like labels or submission headers.
10. After showing the draft, ask in plain English: `If this draft looks right, I can submit it to GitHub now.`
11. Do not mention CLI flags like `--submit` in the user-facing approval question.
12. Only if the user clearly approves, rerun or continue with `--submit` for public bug or feature issues.
13. For security, keep the report private and route the user to `security@openclaw.ai`.

## Common Commands

- Help: `openclaw report --help`
- Bug draft: `openclaw report bug`
- Feature draft: `openclaw report feature`
- Security private report draft: `openclaw report security`
- Public issue submission after approval: add `--submit`

## Flag Mapping

- summary -> `--summary`
- repro -> `--repro`
- expected -> `--expected`
- actual -> `--actual`
- impact -> `--impact`
- previous version -> `--previous-version`
- additional information -> `--additional-information`
- feature problem -> `--problem`
- feature solution -> `--solution`

Use `--additional-information` for details that do not fit neatly into `--repro`, `--expected`, `--actual`, or `--evidence`, including:

- useful loose context
- regression clues
- timelines
- unusual observations
- operator hypotheses worth preserving

Prefer deriving these from the conversation when they are already clear instead of asking the user to restate them.

## Private Security Reports

If the request is a security issue:

- use `openclaw report security` as the source of truth for the private report draft
- do not create a public GitHub issue
- do not include exploit details in chat unless needed to route the report
- ask only for missing required private-report fields
- briefly summarize the category, affected area, and impact in private-report-safe terms only
- tell the user to report it privately to `security@openclaw.ai`

## PII And Secret Redaction

- Let `openclaw report` handle redaction by default.
- If you must quote or summarize content before invoking it, redact tokens, passwords, emails, phone numbers, private-person handles, home-directory names, and unnecessary local file paths.

## Permission Preview

Let `openclaw report` define the preview, readiness, blocked-submission, and created-output wording.

Do not restate or simulate `READY_TO_CREATE`, `SUBMISSION_BLOCKED`, or other CLI output formats inside this skill.

If the user has not clearly approved filing after seeing the full draft, stop before adding `--submit`.

## Notes

- `openclaw report` is the authoritative path for title/body formatting, bounded diagnostics, redaction, degraded diagnostics handling, submission gating, and `gh` failure behavior.
- Keep this skill focused on orchestration, not manual issue authoring.
- Do not invent extra workflow, output schema, or issue-body rules beyond what `openclaw report` already implements.

## Examples

### Example: bug with gateway diagnostics

User says: `OpenClaw times out behind mitmproxy.`

Assistant says:

```text
I’m using the openclaw-feedback skill to prepare an OpenClaw GitHub issue. I want to gather enough context to make the issue accurate and useful for maintainers without over-questioning you. Report generation can take a moment if I include diagnostics or probes.
If you do not want to file an issue, just tell me and I’ll stop.

I need a few bug-report details: what steps reproduce it, what you expected, what actually happened, and the impact.
```

If those fields are not already clear from the diagnosis session, ask for them. Otherwise infer them and run:

```bash
openclaw report bug --summary "Gateway times out behind mitmproxy" --repro "..." --expected "..." --actual "..." --impact "..." --probe gateway
```

Then show the draft itself, not internal report metadata. Only add `--submit` after explicit approval.

After showing the draft, ask:

```text
If this draft looks right, I can submit it to GitHub now.
```

### Example: regression bug with loose extra context

User says: `This worked last week, but after updating it started timing out.`

Assistant says:

```text
I’m using the openclaw-feedback skill to prepare an OpenClaw GitHub issue. I want to gather enough context to make the issue accurate and useful for maintainers without over-questioning you. Report generation can take a moment if I include diagnostics or probes.
If you do not want to file an issue, just tell me and I’ll stop.

I need the repro steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and impact. I can also include the previous version and any extra observations that do not fit neatly into the main bug fields.
```

If the missing facts are not already clear from the conversation or diagnosis session, ask for them. Otherwise infer them and run:

```bash
openclaw report bug --summary "Regression after update" --repro "..." --expected "..." --actual "..." --impact "..." --previous-version "2026.3.14" --additional-information "Worked last week; now every call times out behind the same proxy setup." --probe model
```

Then show the draft and ask:

```text
If this draft looks right, I can submit it to GitHub now.
```

### Example: feature request

User says: `Please add a way to export a report draft without submitting it.`

If the user already gave enough detail, derive the report directly and run:

```bash
openclaw report feature --summary "Export report drafts without submission" --problem "Operators want a clean draft artifact without creating a GitHub issue" --solution "Allow report generation and file output without submit" --impact "Safer scripted issue authoring"
```

Then show the draft and ask:

```text
If this draft looks right, I can submit it to GitHub now.
```

### Example: private security report

User says: `I found a token leak in logs.`

Assistant says:

```text
I’m using the openclaw-feedback skill to route this into the private OpenClaw security-report flow. I want to gather enough context to make the report accurate and actionable while keeping it private.
If you do not want to file a report, just tell me and I’ll stop.
```

Then gather only missing private-report fields and run:

```bash
openclaw report security --title "Token leak in logs" --severity high --impact "..." --component "..." --reproduction "..." --demonstrated-impact "..." --environment "..." --remediation "..."
```

Do not create a public issue.
