Plugins extend OpenClaw with new capabilities: channels, model providers,
agent harnesses, tools, skills, speech, realtime transcription, realtime
voice, media-understanding, image generation, video generation, web fetch, web
search, and more. Some plugins are **core** (shipped with OpenClaw), others
are **external**. Most external plugins are published and discovered through
[ClawHub](/tools/clawhub). Npm remains supported for direct installs and for a
temporary set of OpenClaw-owned plugin packages while that migration finishes.

## Quick start

For copy-paste install, list, uninstall, update, and publishing examples, see
[Manage plugins](/plugins/manage-plugins).

<Steps>
  <Step title="See what is loaded">
    ```bash
    openclaw plugins list
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install a plugin">
    ```bash
    # Search ClawHub plugins
    openclaw plugins search "calendar"

    # From ClawHub
    openclaw plugins install clawhub:openclaw-codex-app-server

    # From npm
    openclaw plugins install npm:@acme/openclaw-plugin

    # From git
    openclaw plugins install git:github.com/acme/openclaw-plugin@v1.0.0

    # From a local directory or archive
    openclaw plugins install ./my-plugin
    openclaw plugins install ./my-plugin.tgz
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart the Gateway">
    ```bash
    openclaw gateway restart
    ```

    Then configure under `plugins.entries.\<id\>.config` in your config file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Chat-native management">
    In a running Gateway, owner-only `/plugins enable` and `/plugins disable`
    trigger the Gateway config reloader. The Gateway reloads plugin runtime
    surfaces in process, and new agent turns rebuild their tool list from the
    refreshed registry. `/plugins install` changes plugin source code, so the
    Gateway requests a restart instead of pretending the current process can
    safely reload already-imported modules.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the plugin">
    ```bash
    openclaw plugins inspect <plugin-id> --runtime --json

    # If the plugin registered a CLI root, run one command from that root.
    openclaw <plugin-command> --help
    ```

    Use `--runtime` when you need to prove registered tools, services, gateway
    methods, hooks, or plugin-owned CLI commands. Plain `inspect` is a cold
    manifest/registry check and intentionally avoids importing plugin runtime.

  </Step>
</Steps>

If you prefer chat-native control, enable `commands.plugins: true` and use:

```text
/plugin install clawhub:<package>
/plugin show <plugin-id>
/plugin enable <plugin-id>
```

The install path uses the same resolver as the CLI: local path/archive, explicit
`clawhub:<pkg>`, explicit `npm:<pkg>`, explicit `git:<repo>`, or bare package
spec through npm.

If config is invalid, install normally fails closed and points you at
`openclaw doctor --fix`. The only recovery exception is a narrow bundled-plugin
reinstall path for plugins that opt into
`openclaw.install.allowInvalidConfigRecovery`.
During Gateway startup, invalid config for one plugin is isolated to that plugin:
startup logs the `plugins.entries.<id>.config` issue, skips that plugin during
load, and keeps other plugins and channels online. Run `openclaw doctor --fix`
to quarantine the bad plugin config by disabling that plugin entry and removing
its invalid config payload; the normal config backup keeps the previous values.
When a channel config references a plugin that is no longer discoverable but the
same stale plugin id remains in plugin config or install records, Gateway startup
logs warnings and skips that channel instead of blocking every other channel.
Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to remove the stale channel/plugin entries; unknown
channel keys without stale-plugin evidence still fail validation so typos stay
visible.
If `plugins.enabled: false` is set, stale plugin references are treated as inert:
Gateway startup skips plugin discovery/load work and `openclaw doctor` preserves
the disabled plugin config instead of auto-removing it. Re-enable plugins before
running doctor cleanup if you want stale plugin ids removed.

Plugin dependency installation happens only during explicit install/update or
doctor repair flows. Gateway startup, config reload, and runtime inspection do
not run package managers or repair dependency trees. Local plugins must already
have their dependencies installed, while npm, git, and ClawHub plugins are
installed under OpenClaw's managed plugin roots. npm dependencies may be hoisted
within OpenClaw's managed npm root; install/update scans that managed root before
trust and uninstall removes npm-managed packages through npm. External plugins
and custom load paths must still be installed through `openclaw plugins install`.
Use `openclaw plugins list --json` to see the static `dependencyStatus` for each
visible plugin without importing runtime code or repairing dependencies.
See [Plugin dependency resolution](/plugins/dependency-resolution) for the
install-time lifecycle.

Source checkouts are pnpm workspaces. If you clone OpenClaw to hack on bundled
plugins, run `pnpm install`; OpenClaw then loads bundled plugins from
`extensions/<id>` so edits and package-local dependencies are used directly.
Plain npm root installs are for packaged OpenClaw, not source checkout
development.

## Plugin types

OpenClaw recognizes two plugin formats:

| Format     | How it works                                                       | Examples                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Native** | `openclaw.plugin.json` + runtime module; executes in-process       | Official plugins, community npm packages               |
| **Bundle** | Codex/Claude/Cursor-compatible layout; mapped to OpenClaw features | `.codex-plugin/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/` |

Both show up under `openclaw plugins list`. See [Plugin Bundles](/plugins/bundles) for bundle details.

If you are writing a native plugin, start with [Building Plugins](/plugins/building-plugins)
and the [Plugin SDK Overview](/plugins/sdk-overview).

## Package entrypoints

Native plugin npm packages must declare `openclaw.extensions` in `package.json`.
Each entry must stay inside the package directory and resolve to a readable
runtime file, or to a TypeScript source file with an inferred built JavaScript
peer such as `src/index.ts` to `dist/index.js`.

Use `openclaw.runtimeExtensions` when published runtime files do not live at the
same paths as the source entries. When present, `runtimeExtensions` must contain
exactly one entry for every `extensions` entry. Mismatched lists fail install and
plugin discovery rather than silently falling back to source paths. If you also
publish `openclaw.setupEntry`, use `openclaw.runtimeSetupEntry` for its built
JavaScript peer; that file is required when declared.

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/openclaw-plugin",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": ["./src/index.ts"],
    "runtimeExtensions": ["./dist/index.js"]
  }
}
```

## Official plugins

### OpenClaw-owned npm packages during migration

ClawHub is the primary distribution path for most plugins. Current packaged
OpenClaw releases already bundle many official plugins, so those do not need
separate npm installs in normal setups. Until every OpenClaw-owned plugin has
migrated to ClawHub, OpenClaw still ships some `@openclaw/*` plugin packages on
npm for older/custom installs and direct npm workflows.

If npm reports an `@openclaw/*` plugin package as deprecated, that package
version is from an older external package train. Use the bundled plugin from
current OpenClaw or a local checkout until a newer npm package is published.

## Configuration

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    enabled: true,
    allow: ["voice-call"],
    deny: ["untrusted-plugin"],
    load: { paths: ["~/Projects/oss/voice-call-plugin"] },
    entries: {
      "voice-call": { enabled: true, config: { provider: "twilio" } },
    },
  },
}
```

| Field            | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`        | Master toggle (default: `true`)                           |
| `allow`          | Plugin allowlist (optional)                               |
| `deny`           | Plugin denylist (optional; deny wins)                     |
| `load.paths`     | Extra plugin files/directories                            |
| `slots`          | Exclusive slot selectors (e.g. `memory`, `contextEngine`) |
| `entries.\<id\>` | Per-plugin toggles + config                               |

`plugins.allow` is exclusive. When it is non-empty, only listed plugins can load
or expose tools, even if `tools.allow` contains `"*"` or a specific plugin-owned
tool name. If a tool allowlist references plugin tools, add the owning plugin ids
to `plugins.allow` or remove `plugins.allow`; `openclaw doctor` warns about this
shape.

Config changes made through `/plugins enable` or `/plugins disable` trigger an
in-process Gateway plugin reload. New agent turns rebuild their tool list from
the refreshed plugin registry. Source-changing operations such as install,
update, and uninstall still restart the Gateway process because already-imported
plugin modules cannot be safely replaced in place.

`openclaw plugins list` is a local plugin registry/config snapshot. An
`enabled` plugin there means the persisted registry and current config allow the
plugin to participate. It does not prove that an already-running remote Gateway
has reloaded or restarted into the same plugin code. On VPS/container setups
with wrapper processes, send restarts or reload-triggering writes to the actual
`openclaw gateway run` process, or use `openclaw gateway restart` against the
running Gateway when the reload reports a failure.

<Accordion title="Plugin states: disabled vs missing vs invalid">
  - **Disabled**: plugin exists but enablement rules turned it off. Config is preserved.
  - **Missing**: config references a plugin id that discovery did not find.
  - **Invalid**: plugin exists but its config does not match the declared schema. Gateway startup skips only that plugin; `openclaw doctor --fix` can quarantine the invalid entry by disabling it and removing its config payload.

</Accordion>

## Discovery and precedence

OpenClaw scans for plugins in this order (first match wins):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Config paths">
    `plugins.load.paths` — explicit file or directory paths. Paths that point
    back at OpenClaw's own packaged bundled plugin directories are ignored;
    run `openclaw doctor --fix` to remove those stale aliases.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Workspace plugins">
    `\<workspace\>/.openclaw/<plugin-root>/*.ts` and `\<workspace\>/.openclaw/<plugin-root>/*/index.ts`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Global plugins">
    `~/.openclaw/<plugin-root>/*.ts` and `~/.openclaw/<plugin-root>/*/index.ts`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bundled plugins">
    Shipped with OpenClaw. Many are enabled by default (model providers, speech).
    Others require explicit enablement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Packaged installs and Docker images normally resolve bundled plugins from the
compiled `dist/extensions` tree. If a bundled plugin source directory is
bind-mounted over the matching packaged source path, for example
`/app/extensions/synology-chat`, OpenClaw treats that mounted source directory
as a bundled source overlay and discovers it before the packaged
`/app/dist/extensions/synology-chat` bundle. This keeps maintainer container
loops working without switching every bundled plugin back to TypeScript source.
Set `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SOURCE_OVERLAYS=1` to force packaged dist bundles
even when source overlay mounts are present.

### Enablement rules

- `plugins.enabled: false` disables all plugins and skips plugin discovery/load work
- `plugins.deny` always wins over allow
- `plugins.entries.\<id\>.enabled: false` disables that plugin
- Workspace-origin plugins are **disabled by default** (must be explicitly enabled)
- Bundled plugins follow the built-in default-on set unless overridden
- Exclusive slots can force-enable the selected plugin for that slot
- Some bundled opt-in plugins are enabled automatically when config names a
  plugin-owned surface, such as a provider model ref, channel config, or harness
  runtime
- Stale plugin config is preserved while `plugins.enabled: false` is active;
  re-enable plugins before running doctor cleanup if you want stale ids removed
- OpenAI-family Codex routes keep separate plugin boundaries:
  `openai-codex/*` belongs to the OpenAI plugin, while the bundled Codex
  app-server plugin is selected by `agentRuntime.id: "codex"` or legacy
  `codex/*` model refs

## Troubleshooting runtime hooks

If a plugin appears in `plugins list` but `register(api)` side effects or hooks
do not run in live chat traffic, check these first:

- Run `openclaw gateway status --deep --require-rpc` and confirm the active
  Gateway URL, profile, config path, and process are the ones you are editing.
- Restart the live Gateway after plugin install/config/code changes. In wrapper
  containers, PID 1 may only be a supervisor; restart or signal the child
  `openclaw gateway run` process.
- Use `openclaw plugins inspect <id> --runtime --json` to confirm hook registrations and
  diagnostics. Non-bundled conversation hooks such as `llm_input`,
  `llm_output`, `before_agent_finalize`, and `agent_end` need
  `plugins.entries.<id>.hooks.allowConversationAccess=true`.
- For model switching, prefer `before_model_resolve`. It runs before model
  resolution for agent turns; `llm_output` only runs after a model attempt
  produces assistant output.
- For proof of the effective session model, use `openclaw sessions` or the
  Gateway session/status surfaces and, when debugging provider payloads, start
  the Gateway with `--raw-stream --raw-stream-path <path>`.

### Slow plugin tool setup

If agent turns appear to stall while preparing tools, enable trace logging and
check for plugin tool factory timing lines:

```bash
openclaw config set logging.level trace
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for:

```text
[trace:plugin-tools] factory timings ...
```

The summary lists total factory time and the slowest plugin tool factories,
including plugin id, declared tool names, result shape, and whether the tool is
optional. Slow lines are promoted to warnings when a single factory takes at
least 1s or total plugin tool factory prep takes at least 5s.

OpenClaw caches successful plugin tool factory results for repeated resolutions
with the same effective request context. The cache key includes the effective
runtime config, workspace, agent/session ids, sandbox policy, browser settings,
delivery context, requester identity, and ownership state, so factories that
depend on those trusted fields are re-run when the context changes.

If one plugin dominates the timing, inspect its runtime registrations:

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect <plugin-id> --runtime --json
```

Then update, reinstall, or disable that plugin. Plugin authors should move
expensive dependency loading behind the tool execution path instead of doing it
inside the tool factory.

### Duplicate channel or tool ownership

Symptoms:

- `channel already registered: <channel-id> (<plugin-id>)`
- `channel setup already registered: <channel-id> (<plugin-id>)`
- `plugin tool name conflict (<plugin-id>): <tool-name>`

These mean more than one enabled plugin is trying to own the same channel,
setup flow, or tool name. The most common cause is an external channel plugin
installed beside a bundled plugin that now provides the same channel id.

Debug steps:

- Run `openclaw plugins list --enabled --verbose` to see every enabled plugin
  and origin.
- Run `openclaw plugins inspect <id> --runtime --json` for each suspected plugin and
  compare `channels`, `channelConfigs`, `tools`, and diagnostics.
- Run `openclaw plugins registry --refresh` after installing or removing
  plugin packages so persisted metadata reflects the current install.
- Restart the Gateway after install, registry, or config changes.

Fix options:

- If one plugin intentionally replaces another for the same channel id, the
  preferred plugin should declare `channelConfigs.<channel-id>.preferOver` with
  the lower-priority plugin id. See [/plugins/manifest#replacing-another-channel-plugin](/plugins/manifest#replacing-another-channel-plugin).
- If the duplicate is accidental, disable one side with
  `plugins.entries.<plugin-id>.enabled: false` or remove the stale plugin
  install.
- If you explicitly enabled both plugins, OpenClaw keeps that request and
  reports the conflict. Pick one owner for the channel or rename plugin-owned
  tools so the runtime surface is unambiguous.

## Plugin slots (exclusive categories)

Some categories are exclusive (only one active at a time):

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    slots: {
      memory: "memory-core", // or "none" to disable
      contextEngine: "legacy", // or a plugin id
    },
  },
}
```

| Slot            | What it controls      | Default             |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| `memory`        | Active memory plugin  | `memory-core`       |
| `contextEngine` | Active context engine | `legacy` (built-in) |

openclaw plugins disable <id>
```

Bundled plugins ship with OpenClaw. Many are enabled by default (for example
bundled model providers, bundled speech providers, and the bundled browser
plugin). Other bundled plugins still need `openclaw plugins enable <id>`.

`--force` overwrites an existing installed plugin or hook pack in place. Use
`openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>` for routine upgrades of tracked npm
plugins. It is not supported with `--link`, which reuses the source path instead
of copying over a managed install target.

When `plugins.allow` is already set, `openclaw plugins install` adds the
installed plugin id to that allowlist before enabling it. If the same plugin id
is present in `plugins.deny`, install removes that stale deny entry so the
explicit install is immediately loadable after restart.

OpenClaw keeps a persisted local plugin registry as the cold read model for
plugin inventory, contribution ownership, and startup planning. Install, update,
uninstall, enable, and disable flows refresh that registry after changing plugin
state. The same `plugins/installs.json` file keeps durable install metadata in
top-level `installRecords` and rebuildable manifest metadata in `plugins`. If
the registry is missing, stale, or invalid, `openclaw plugins registry
--refresh` rebuilds its manifest view from install records, config policy, and
manifest/package metadata without loading plugin runtime modules.
`openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>` applies to tracked installs. Passing
an npm package spec with a dist-tag or exact version resolves the package name
back to the tracked plugin record and records the new spec for future updates.
Passing the package name without a version moves an exact pinned install back to
the registry's default release line. If the installed npm plugin already matches
the resolved version and recorded artifact identity, OpenClaw skips the update
without downloading, reinstalling, or rewriting config.

`--pin` is npm-only. It is not supported with `--marketplace`, because
marketplace installs persist marketplace source metadata instead of an npm spec.

`--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` is a break-glass override for false
positives from the built-in dangerous-code scanner. It allows plugin installs
and plugin updates to continue past built-in `critical` findings, but it still
does not bypass plugin `before_install` policy blocks or scan-failure blocking.
Install scans ignore common test files and directories such as `tests/`,
`__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, and `*.spec.*` to avoid blocking packaged test mocks;
declared plugin runtime entrypoints are still scanned even if they use one of
those names.

This CLI flag applies to plugin install/update flows only. Gateway-backed skill
dependency installs use the matching `dangerouslyForceUnsafeInstall` request
override instead, while `openclaw skills install` remains the separate ClawHub
skill download/install flow.

If a plugin you published on ClawHub is hidden or blocked by a scan, open the
ClawHub dashboard or run `clawhub package rescan <name>` to ask ClawHub to check
it again. `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` only affects installs on your own
machine; it does not ask ClawHub to rescan the plugin or make a blocked release
public.

Compatible bundles participate in the same plugin list/inspect/enable/disable
flow. Current runtime support includes bundle skills, Claude command-skills,
Claude `settings.json` defaults, Claude `.lsp.json` and manifest-declared
`lspServers` defaults, Cursor command-skills, and compatible Codex hook
directories.

`openclaw plugins inspect <id>` also reports detected bundle capabilities plus
supported or unsupported MCP and LSP server entries for bundle-backed plugins.

Marketplace sources can be a Claude known-marketplace name from
`~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`, a local marketplace root or
`marketplace.json` path, a GitHub shorthand like `owner/repo`, a GitHub repo
URL, or a git URL. For remote marketplaces, plugin entries must stay inside the
cloned marketplace repo and use relative path sources only.

See [`openclaw plugins` CLI reference](/cli/plugins) for full details.

## Plugin API overview

Native plugins export an entry object that exposes `register(api)`. Older
plugins may still use `activate(api)` as a legacy alias, but new plugins should
use `register`.

```typescript
export default definePluginEntry({
  id: "my-plugin",
  name: "My Plugin",
  register(api) {
    api.registerProvider({
      /* ... */
    });
    api.registerTool({
      /* ... */
    });
    api.registerChannel({
      /* ... */
    });
  },
});
```

OpenClaw loads the entry object and calls `register(api)` during plugin
activation. The loader still falls back to `activate(api)` for older plugins,
but bundled plugins and new external plugins should treat `register` as the
public contract.

`api.registrationMode` tells a plugin why its entry is being loaded:

| Mode            | Meaning                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `full`          | Runtime activation. Register tools, hooks, services, commands, routes, and other live side effects.                              |
| `discovery`     | Read-only capability discovery. Register providers and metadata; trusted plugin entry code may load, but skip live side effects. |
| `setup-only`    | Channel setup metadata loading through a lightweight setup entry.                                                                |
| `setup-runtime` | Channel setup loading that also needs the runtime entry.                                                                         |
| `cli-metadata`  | CLI command metadata collection only.                                                                                            |

Plugin entries that open sockets, databases, background workers, or long-lived
clients should guard those side effects with `api.registrationMode === "full"`.
Discovery loads are cached separately from activating loads and do not replace
the running Gateway registry. Discovery is non-activating, not import-free:
OpenClaw may evaluate the trusted plugin entry or channel plugin module to build
the snapshot. Keep module top levels lightweight and side-effect-free, and move
network clients, subprocesses, listeners, credential reads, and service startup
behind full-runtime paths.

Common registration methods:

| Method                                  | What it registers           |

| `registerProvider`                      | Model provider (LLM)        |
| `registerChannel`                       | Chat channel                |
| `registerTool`                          | Agent tool                  |
| `registerHook` / `on(...)`              | Lifecycle hooks             |
| `registerSpeechProvider`                | Text-to-speech / STT        |
| `registerRealtimeTranscriptionProvider` | Streaming STT               |
| `registerRealtimeVoiceProvider`         | Duplex realtime voice       |
| `registerMediaUnderstandingProvider`    | Image/audio analysis        |
| `registerImageGenerationProvider`       | Image generation            |
| `registerMusicGenerationProvider`       | Music generation            |
| `registerVideoGenerationProvider`       | Video generation            |
| `registerWebFetchProvider`              | Web fetch / scrape provider |
| `registerWebSearchProvider`             | Web search                  |
| `registerHttpRoute`                     | HTTP endpoint               |
| `registerCommand` / `registerCli`       | CLI commands                |
| `registerContextEngine`                 | Context engine              |

Hook guard behavior for typed lifecycle hooks:

- `before_tool_call`: `{ block: true }` is terminal; lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `before_tool_call`: `{ block: false }` is a no-op and does not clear an earlier block.
- `before_install`: `{ block: true }` is terminal; lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `before_install`: `{ block: false }` is a no-op and does not clear an earlier block.
- `message_sending`: `{ cancel: true }` is terminal; lower-priority handlers are skipped.
- `message_sending`: `{ cancel: false }` is a no-op and does not clear an earlier cancel.

Native Codex app-server runs bridge Codex-native tool events back into this
hook surface. Plugins can block native Codex tools through `before_tool_call`,
observe results through `after_tool_call`, and participate in Codex
`PermissionRequest` approvals. The bridge does not rewrite Codex-native tool
arguments yet. The exact Codex runtime support boundary lives in the
[Codex harness v1 support contract](/plugins/codex-harness#v1-support-contract).
