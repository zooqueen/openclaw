# ACP agents

[Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) sessions let OpenClaw run external coding harnesses (for example Pi, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, OpenClaw ACP, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and other supported ACPX harnesses) through an ACP backend plugin.

If you ask OpenClaw in plain language to "run this in Codex" or "start Claude Code in a thread", OpenClaw should route that request to the ACP runtime (not the native sub-agent runtime). Each ACP session spawn is tracked as a [background task](/automation/tasks).

If you want Codex or Claude Code to connect as an external MCP client directly
to existing OpenClaw channel conversations, use [`openclaw mcp serve`](/cli/mcp)
instead of ACP.

## Which page do I want?

There are three nearby surfaces that are easy to confuse:

## Does this work out of the box?

Usually, yes. Fresh installs ship the bundled `acpx` runtime plugin enabled by default, with a plugin-local pinned `acpx` binary that OpenClaw probes and self-repairs on startup. Run `/acp doctor` for a readiness check.

First-run gotchas:

- Target harness adapters (Codex, Claude, etc.) may be fetched on demand with `npx` the first time you use them.
- Vendor auth still has to exist on the host for that harness.
- If the host has no npm or network access, first-run adapter fetches fail until caches are pre-warmed or the adapter is installed another way.

## Operator runbook

Quick `/acp` flow from chat:

1. **Spawn** — `/acp spawn codex --bind here` or `/acp spawn codex --mode persistent --thread auto`
2. **Work** in the bound conversation or thread (or target the session key explicitly).
3. **Check state** — `/acp status`
4. **Tune** — `/acp model <provider/model>`, `/acp permissions <profile>`, `/acp timeout <seconds>`
5. **Steer** without replacing context — `/acp steer tighten logging and continue`
6. **Stop** — `/acp cancel` (current turn) or `/acp close` (session + bindings)

Natural-language triggers that should route to the ACP runtime:

- "Bind this Discord channel to Codex."
- "Start a persistent Codex session in a thread here."
- "Run this as a one-shot Claude Code ACP session and summarize the result."
- "Use Gemini CLI for this task in a thread, then keep follow-ups in that same thread."

OpenClaw picks `runtime: "acp"`, resolves the harness `agentId`, binds to the current conversation or thread when supported, and routes follow-ups to that session until close/expiry.

## ACP versus sub-agents

Use ACP when you want an external harness runtime. Use sub-agents when you want OpenClaw-native delegated runs.

| Area          | ACP session                           | Sub-agent run                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Runtime       | ACP backend plugin (for example acpx) | OpenClaw native sub-agent runtime  |
| Session key   | `agent:<agentId>:acp:<uuid>`          | `agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`  |
| Main commands | `/acp ...`                            | `/subagents ...`                   |
| Spawn tool    | `sessions_spawn` with `runtime:"acp"` | `sessions_spawn` (default runtime) |

See also [Sub-agents](/tools/subagents).

## How ACP runs Claude Code

For Claude Code through ACP, the stack is:

1. OpenClaw ACP session control plane
2. bundled `acpx` runtime plugin
3. Claude ACP adapter
4. Claude-side runtime/session machinery

Important distinction:

- ACP Claude is a harness session with ACP controls, session resume, background-task tracking, and optional conversation/thread binding.
- CLI backends are separate text-only local fallback runtimes. See [CLI Backends](/gateway/cli-backends).

For operators, the practical rule is:

- want `/acp spawn`, bindable sessions, runtime controls, or persistent harness work: use ACP
- want simple local text fallback through the raw CLI: use CLI backends

## Bound sessions

### Current-conversation binds

`/acp spawn <harness> --bind here` pins the current conversation to the spawned ACP session — no child thread, same chat surface. OpenClaw keeps owning transport, auth, safety, and delivery; follow-up messages in that conversation route to the same session; `/new` and `/reset` reset the session in place; `/acp close` removes the binding.

Mental model:

- **chat surface** — where people keep talking (Discord channel, Telegram topic, iMessage chat).
- **ACP session** — the durable Codex/Claude/Gemini runtime state OpenClaw routes to.
- **child thread/topic** — an optional extra messaging surface created only by `--thread ...`.
- **runtime workspace** — the filesystem location (`cwd`, repo checkout, backend workspace) where the harness runs. Independent of the chat surface.

Examples:

- `/acp spawn codex --bind here` — keep this chat, spawn or attach Codex, route future messages here.
- `/acp spawn codex --thread auto` — OpenClaw may create a child thread/topic and bind there.
- `/acp spawn codex --bind here --cwd /workspace/repo` — same chat binding, Codex runs in `/workspace/repo`.

Notes:

- `--bind here` and `--thread ...` are mutually exclusive.
- `--bind here` only works on channels that advertise current-conversation binding; OpenClaw returns a clear unsupported message otherwise. Bindings persist across gateway restarts.
- On Discord, `spawnAcpSessions` is only required when OpenClaw needs to create a child thread for `--thread auto|here` — not for `--bind here`.
- If you spawn to a different ACP agent without `--cwd`, OpenClaw inherits the **target agent's** workspace by default. Missing inherited paths (`ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR`) fall back to the backend default; other access errors (e.g. `EACCES`) surface as spawn errors.

### Thread-bound sessions

When thread bindings are enabled for a channel adapter, ACP sessions can be bound to threads:

- OpenClaw binds a thread to a target ACP session.
- Follow-up messages in that thread route to the bound ACP session.
- ACP output is delivered back to the same thread.
- Unfocus/close/archive/idle-timeout or max-age expiry removes the binding.

Thread binding support is adapter-specific. If the active channel adapter does not support thread bindings, OpenClaw returns a clear unsupported/unavailable message.

Required feature flags for thread-bound ACP:

- `acp.enabled=true`
- `acp.dispatch.enabled` is on by default (set `false` to pause ACP dispatch)
- Channel-adapter ACP thread-spawn flag enabled (adapter-specific)
  - Discord: `channels.discord.threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions=true`
  - Telegram: `channels.telegram.threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions=true`

### Thread supporting channels

- Any channel adapter that exposes session/thread binding capability.
- Current built-in support:
  - Discord threads/channels
  - Telegram topics (forum topics in groups/supergroups and DM topics)
- Plugin channels can add support through the same binding interface.

## Channel specific settings

For non-ephemeral workflows, configure persistent ACP bindings in top-level `bindings[]` entries.

### Binding model

- `bindings[].type="acp"` marks a persistent ACP conversation binding.
- `bindings[].match` identifies the target conversation:
  - Discord channel or thread: `match.channel="discord"` + `match.peer.id="<channelOrThreadId>"`
  - Telegram forum topic: `match.channel="telegram"` + `match.peer.id="<chatId>:topic:<topicId>"`
  - BlueBubbles DM/group chat: `match.channel="bluebubbles"` + `match.peer.id="<handle|chat_id:*|chat_guid:*|chat_identifier:*>"`
    Prefer `chat_id:*` or `chat_identifier:*` for stable group bindings.
  - iMessage DM/group chat: `match.channel="imessage"` + `match.peer.id="<handle|chat_id:*|chat_guid:*|chat_identifier:*>"`
    Prefer `chat_id:*` for stable group bindings.
- `bindings[].agentId` is the owning OpenClaw agent id.
- Optional ACP overrides live under `bindings[].acp`:
  - `mode` (`persistent` or `oneshot`)
  - `label`
  - `cwd`
  - `backend`

### Runtime defaults per agent

Use `agents.list[].runtime` to define ACP defaults once per agent:

- `agents.list[].runtime.type="acp"`
- `agents.list[].runtime.acp.agent` (harness id, for example `codex` or `claude`)
- `agents.list[].runtime.acp.backend`
- `agents.list[].runtime.acp.mode`
- `agents.list[].runtime.acp.cwd`

Override precedence for ACP bound sessions:

1. `bindings[].acp.*`
2. `agents.list[].runtime.acp.*`
3. global ACP defaults (for example `acp.backend`)

Example:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "codex",
        runtime: {
          type: "acp",
          acp: {
            agent: "codex",
            backend: "acpx",
            mode: "persistent",
            cwd: "/workspace/openclaw",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        id: "claude",
        runtime: {
          type: "acp",
          acp: { agent: "claude", backend: "acpx", mode: "persistent" },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  bindings: [
    {
      type: "acp",
      agentId: "codex",
      match: {
        channel: "discord",
        accountId: "default",
        peer: { kind: "channel", id: "222222222222222222" },
      },
      acp: { label: "codex-main" },
    },
    {
      type: "acp",
      agentId: "claude",
      match: {
        channel: "telegram",
        accountId: "default",
        peer: { kind: "group", id: "-1001234567890:topic:42" },
      },
      acp: { cwd: "/workspace/repo-b" },
    },
    {
      type: "route",
      agentId: "main",
      match: { channel: "discord", accountId: "default" },
    },
    {
      type: "route",
      agentId: "main",
      match: { channel: "telegram", accountId: "default" },
    },
  ],
  channels: {
    discord: {
      guilds: {
        "111111111111111111": {
          channels: {
            "222222222222222222": { requireMention: false },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    telegram: {
      groups: {
        "-1001234567890": {
          topics: { "42": { requireMention: false } },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Behavior:

- OpenClaw ensures the configured ACP session exists before use.
- Messages in that channel or topic route to the configured ACP session.
- In bound conversations, `/new` and `/reset` reset the same ACP session key in place.
- Temporary runtime bindings (for example created by thread-focus flows) still apply where present.
- For cross-agent ACP spawns without an explicit `cwd`, OpenClaw inherits the target agent workspace from agent config.
- Missing inherited workspace paths fall back to the backend default cwd; non-missing access failures surface as spawn errors.

## Start ACP sessions (interfaces)

### From `sessions_spawn`

Use `runtime: "acp"` to start an ACP session from an agent turn or tool call.

```json
{
  "task": "Open the repo and summarize failing tests",
  "runtime": "acp",
  "agentId": "codex",
  "thread": true,
  "mode": "session"
}
```

Notes:

- `runtime` defaults to `subagent`, so set `runtime: "acp"` explicitly for ACP sessions.
- If `agentId` is omitted, OpenClaw uses `acp.defaultAgent` when configured.
- `mode: "session"` requires `thread: true` to keep a persistent bound conversation.

Interface details:

- `task` (required): initial prompt sent to the ACP session.
- `runtime` (required for ACP): must be `"acp"`.
- `agentId` (optional): ACP target harness id. Falls back to `acp.defaultAgent` if set.
- `thread` (optional, default `false`): request thread binding flow where supported.
- `mode` (optional): `run` (one-shot) or `session` (persistent).
  - default is `run`
  - if `thread: true` and mode omitted, OpenClaw may default to persistent behavior per runtime path
  - `mode: "session"` requires `thread: true`
- `cwd` (optional): requested runtime working directory (validated by backend/runtime policy). If omitted, ACP spawn inherits the target agent workspace when configured; missing inherited paths fall back to backend defaults, while real access errors are returned.
- `label` (optional): operator-facing label used in session/banner text.
- `resumeSessionId` (optional): resume an existing ACP session instead of creating a new one. The agent replays its conversation history via `session/load`. Requires `runtime: "acp"`.
- `streamTo` (optional): `"parent"` streams initial ACP run progress summaries back to the requester session as system events.
  - When available, accepted responses include `streamLogPath` pointing to a session-scoped JSONL log (`<sessionId>.acp-stream.jsonl`) you can tail for full relay history.
- `model` (optional): explicit model override for the ACP child session. Honored for `runtime: "acp"` so the child uses the requested model instead of silently falling back to the target agent default.

## Delivery model

ACP sessions can be either interactive workspaces or parent-owned background work. The delivery path depends on that shape.

### Interactive ACP sessions

Interactive sessions are meant to keep talking on a visible chat surface:

- `/acp spawn ... --bind here` binds the current conversation to the ACP session.
- `/acp spawn ... --thread ...` binds a channel thread/topic to the ACP session.
- Persistent configured `bindings[].type="acp"` route matching conversations to the same ACP session.

Follow-up messages in the bound conversation route directly to the ACP session, and ACP output is delivered back to that same channel/thread/topic.

### Parent-owned one-shot ACP sessions

One-shot ACP sessions spawned by another agent run are background children, similar to sub-agents:

- The parent asks for work with `sessions_spawn({ runtime: "acp", mode: "run" })`.
- The child runs in its own ACP harness session.
- Completion reports back through the internal task-completion announce path.
- The parent rewrites the child result in normal assistant voice when a user-facing reply is useful.

Do not treat this path as a peer-to-peer chat between parent and child. The child already has a completion channel back to the parent.

### `sessions_send` and A2A delivery

`sessions_send` can target another session after spawn. For normal peer sessions, OpenClaw uses an agent-to-agent (A2A) follow-up path after injecting the message:

- wait for the target session's reply
- optionally let requester and target exchange a bounded number of follow-up turns
- ask the target to produce an announce message
- deliver that announce to the visible channel or thread

That A2A path is a fallback for peer sends where the sender needs a visible follow-up. It stays enabled when an unrelated session can see and message an ACP target, for example under broad `tools.sessions.visibility` settings.

OpenClaw skips the A2A follow-up only when the requester is the parent of its own parent-owned one-shot ACP child. In that case, running A2A on top of task completion can wake the parent with the child's result, forward the parent's reply back into the child, and create a parent/child echo loop. The `sessions_send` result reports `delivery.status="skipped"` for that owned-child case because the completion path is already responsible for the result.

### Resume an existing session

Use `resumeSessionId` to continue a previous ACP session instead of starting fresh. The agent replays its conversation history via `session/load`, so it picks up with full context of what came before.

```json
{
  "task": "Continue where we left off — fix the remaining test failures",
  "runtime": "acp",
  "agentId": "codex",
  "resumeSessionId": "<previous-session-id>"
}
```

Common use cases:

- Hand off a Codex session from your laptop to your phone — tell your agent to pick up where you left off
- Continue a coding session you started interactively in the CLI, now headlessly through your agent
- Pick up work that was interrupted by a gateway restart or idle timeout

Notes:

- `resumeSessionId` requires `runtime: "acp"` — returns an error if used with the sub-agent runtime.
- `resumeSessionId` restores the upstream ACP conversation history; `thread` and `mode` still apply normally to the new OpenClaw session you are creating, so `mode: "session"` still requires `thread: true`.
- The target agent must support `session/load` (Codex and Claude Code do).
- If the session ID isn't found, the spawn fails with a clear error — no silent fallback to a new session.

<Accordion title="Post-deploy smoke test">

After a gateway deploy, run a live end-to-end check rather than trusting unit tests:

1. Verify the deployed gateway version and commit on the target host.
2. Open a temporary ACPX bridge session to a live agent.
3. Ask that agent to call `sessions_spawn` with `runtime: "acp"`, `agentId: "codex"`, `mode: "run"`, and task `Reply with exactly LIVE-ACP-SPAWN-OK`.
4. Verify `accepted=yes`, a real `childSessionKey`, and no validator error.
5. Clean up the temporary bridge session.

Keep the gate on `mode: "run"` and skip `streamTo: "parent"` — thread-bound `mode: "session"` and stream-relay paths are separate richer integration passes.

</Accordion>

## Sandbox compatibility

ACP sessions currently run on the host runtime, not inside the OpenClaw sandbox.

Current limitations:

- If the requester session is sandboxed, ACP spawns are blocked for both `sessions_spawn({ runtime: "acp" })` and `/acp spawn`.
  - Error: `Sandboxed sessions cannot spawn ACP sessions because runtime="acp" runs on the host. Use runtime="subagent" from sandboxed sessions.`
- `sessions_spawn` with `runtime: "acp"` does not support `sandbox: "require"`.
  - Error: `sessions_spawn sandbox="require" is unsupported for runtime="acp" because ACP sessions run outside the sandbox. Use runtime="subagent" or sandbox="inherit".`

Use `runtime: "subagent"` when you need sandbox-enforced execution.

### From `/acp` command

Use `/acp spawn` for explicit operator control from chat when needed.

```text
/acp spawn codex --mode persistent --thread auto
/acp spawn codex --mode oneshot --thread off
/acp spawn codex --bind here
/acp spawn codex --thread here
```

Key flags:

- `--mode persistent|oneshot`
- `--bind here|off`
- `--thread auto|here|off`
- `--cwd <absolute-path>`
- `--label <name>`

See [Slash Commands](/tools/slash-commands).

## Session target resolution

Most `/acp` actions accept an optional session target (`session-key`, `session-id`, or `session-label`).

Resolution order:

1. Explicit target argument (or `--session` for `/acp steer`)
   - tries key
   - then UUID-shaped session id
   - then label
2. Current thread binding (if this conversation/thread is bound to an ACP session)
3. Current requester session fallback

Current-conversation bindings and thread bindings both participate in step 2.

If no target resolves, OpenClaw returns a clear error (`Unable to resolve session target: ...`).

## Spawn bind modes

`/acp spawn` supports `--bind here|off`.

| Mode   | Behavior                                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `here` | Bind the current active conversation in place; fail if none is active. |
| `off`  | Do not create a current-conversation binding.                          |

Notes:

- `--bind here` is the simplest operator path for "make this channel or chat Codex-backed."
- `--bind here` does not create a child thread.
- `--bind here` is only available on channels that expose current-conversation binding support.
- `--bind` and `--thread` cannot be combined in the same `/acp spawn` call.

## Spawn thread modes

`/acp spawn` supports `--thread auto|here|off`.

| Mode   | Behavior                                                                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto` | In an active thread: bind that thread. Outside a thread: create/bind a child thread when supported. |
| `here` | Require current active thread; fail if not in one.                                                  |
| `off`  | No binding. Session starts unbound.                                                                 |

Notes:

- On non-thread binding surfaces, default behavior is effectively `off`.
- Thread-bound spawn requires channel policy support:
  - Discord: `channels.discord.threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions=true`
  - Telegram: `channels.telegram.threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions=true`
- Use `--bind here` when you want to pin the current conversation without creating a child thread.

## ACP controls

| Command              | What it does                                              | Example                                                       |

| `/acp timeout`       | Set runtime timeout (seconds).                            | `/acp timeout 120`                                            |

`/acp status` shows the effective runtime options plus runtime-level and backend-level session identifiers. Unsupported-control errors surface clearly when a backend lacks a capability. `/acp sessions` reads the store for the current bound or requester session; target tokens (`session-key`, `session-id`, or `session-label`) resolve through gateway session discovery, including custom per-agent `session.store` roots.

## Runtime options mapping

`/acp` has convenience commands and a generic setter.

Equivalent operations:

- `/acp model <id>` maps to runtime config key `model`.
- `/acp permissions <profile>` maps to runtime config key `approval_policy`.
- `/acp timeout <seconds>` maps to runtime config key `timeout`.
- `/acp cwd <path>` updates runtime cwd override directly.
- `/acp set <key> <value>` is the generic path.
  - Special case: `key=cwd` uses the cwd override path.
- `/acp reset-options` clears all runtime overrides for target session.

## acpx harness support (current)

Current acpx built-in harness aliases:

- `claude`
- `codex`
- `copilot`
- `cursor` (Cursor CLI: `cursor-agent acp`)
- `droid`
- `gemini`
- `iflow`
- `kilocode`
- `kimi`
- `kiro`
- `openclaw`
- `opencode`
- `pi`
- `qwen`

When OpenClaw uses the acpx backend, prefer these values for `agentId` unless your acpx config defines custom agent aliases.
If your local Cursor install still exposes ACP as `agent acp`, override the `cursor` agent command in your acpx config instead of changing the built-in default.

Direct acpx CLI usage can also target arbitrary adapters via `--agent <command>`, but that raw escape hatch is an acpx CLI feature (not the normal OpenClaw `agentId` path).

## Required config

Core ACP baseline:

```json5
{
  acp: {
    enabled: true,
    // Optional. Default is true; set false to pause ACP dispatch while keeping /acp controls.
    dispatch: { enabled: true },
    backend: "acpx",
    defaultAgent: "codex",
    allowedAgents: [
      "claude",
      "codex",
      "copilot",
      "cursor",
      "droid",
      "gemini",
      "iflow",
      "kilocode",
      "kimi",
      "kiro",
      "openclaw",
      "opencode",
      "pi",
      "qwen",
    ],
    maxConcurrentSessions: 8,
    stream: {
      coalesceIdleMs: 300,
      maxChunkChars: 1200,
    },
    runtime: {
      ttlMinutes: 120,
    },
  },
}
```

Thread binding config is channel-adapter specific. Example for Discord:

```json5
{
  session: {
    threadBindings: {
      enabled: true,
      idleHours: 24,
      maxAgeHours: 0,
    },
  },
  channels: {
    discord: {
      threadBindings: {
        enabled: true,
        spawnAcpSessions: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

If thread-bound ACP spawn does not work, verify the adapter feature flag first:

- Discord: `channels.discord.threadBindings.spawnAcpSessions=true`

Current-conversation binds do not require child-thread creation. They require an active conversation context and a channel adapter that exposes ACP conversation bindings.

See [Configuration Reference](/gateway/configuration-reference).

## Plugin setup for acpx backend

Fresh installs ship the bundled `acpx` runtime plugin enabled by default, so ACP
usually works without a manual plugin install step.

Start with:

```text
/acp doctor
```

If you disabled `acpx`, denied it via `plugins.allow` / `plugins.deny`, or want
to switch to a local development checkout, use the explicit plugin path:

```bash
openclaw plugins install acpx
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.enabled true
```

Local workspace install during development:

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./path/to/local/acpx-plugin
```

Then verify backend health:

```text
/acp doctor
```

### acpx command and version configuration

By default, the bundled `acpx` plugin uses its plugin-local pinned binary (`node_modules/.bin/acpx` inside the plugin package). Startup registers the backend as not-ready and a background job verifies `acpx --version`; if the binary is missing or mismatched, it runs `npm install --omit=dev --no-save acpx@<pinned>` and re-verifies. The gateway stays non-blocking throughout.

Override the command or version in plugin config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "acpx": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "command": "../acpx/dist/cli.js",
          "expectedVersion": "any"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `command` accepts an absolute path, relative path (resolved from the OpenClaw workspace), or command name.
- `expectedVersion: "any"` disables strict version matching.
- Custom `command` paths disable plugin-local auto-install.

See [Plugins](/tools/plugin).

### Automatic dependency install

When you install OpenClaw globally with `npm install -g openclaw`, the acpx
runtime dependencies (platform-specific binaries) are installed automatically
via a postinstall hook. If the automatic install fails, the gateway still starts
normally and reports the missing dependency through `openclaw acp doctor`.

### Plugin tools MCP bridge

By default, ACPX sessions do **not** expose OpenClaw plugin-registered tools to
the ACP harness.

If you want ACP agents such as Codex or Claude Code to call installed
OpenClaw plugin tools such as memory recall/store, enable the dedicated bridge:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.pluginToolsMcpBridge true
```

What this does:

- Injects a built-in MCP server named `openclaw-plugin-tools` into ACPX session
  bootstrap.
- Exposes plugin tools already registered by installed and enabled OpenClaw
  plugins.
- Keeps the feature explicit and default-off.

Security and trust notes:

- This expands the ACP harness tool surface.
- ACP agents get access only to plugin tools already active in the gateway.
- Treat this as the same trust boundary as letting those plugins execute in
  OpenClaw itself.
- Review installed plugins before enabling it.

Custom `mcpServers` still work as before. The built-in plugin-tools bridge is an
additional opt-in convenience, not a replacement for generic MCP server config.

### OpenClaw tools MCP bridge

By default, ACPX sessions also do **not** expose built-in OpenClaw tools through
MCP. Enable the separate core-tools bridge when an ACP agent needs selected
built-in tools such as `cron`:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.openClawToolsMcpBridge true
```

What this does:

- Injects a built-in MCP server named `openclaw-tools` into ACPX session
  bootstrap.
- Exposes selected built-in OpenClaw tools. The initial server exposes `cron`.
- Keeps core-tool exposure explicit and default-off.

### Runtime timeout configuration

The bundled `acpx` plugin defaults embedded runtime turns to a 120-second
timeout. This gives slower harnesses such as Gemini CLI enough time to complete
ACP startup and initialization. Override it if your host needs a different
runtime limit:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.timeoutSeconds 180
```

Restart the gateway after changing this value.

### Health probe agent configuration

The bundled `acpx` plugin probes one harness agent while deciding whether the
embedded runtime backend is ready. It defaults to `codex`. If your deployment
uses a different default ACP agent, set the probe agent to the same id:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.probeAgent claude
```

Restart the gateway after changing this value.

## Permission configuration

ACP sessions run non-interactively — there is no TTY to approve or deny file-write and shell-exec permission prompts. The acpx plugin provides two config keys that control how permissions are handled:

These ACPX harness permissions are separate from OpenClaw exec approvals and separate from CLI-backend vendor bypass flags such as Claude CLI `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. ACPX `approve-all` is the harness-level break-glass switch for ACP sessions.

### `permissionMode`

Controls which operations the harness agent can perform without prompting.

| Value           | Behavior                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `approve-all`   | Auto-approve all file writes and shell commands.          |
| `approve-reads` | Auto-approve reads only; writes and exec require prompts. |
| `deny-all`      | Deny all permission prompts.                              |

### `nonInteractivePermissions`

Controls what happens when a permission prompt would be shown but no interactive TTY is available (which is always the case for ACP sessions).

| Value  | Behavior                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fail` | Abort the session with `AcpRuntimeError`. **(default)**           |
| `deny` | Silently deny the permission and continue (graceful degradation). |

### Configuration

Set via plugin config:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.permissionMode approve-all
openclaw config set plugins.entries.acpx.config.nonInteractivePermissions fail
```

Restart the gateway after changing these values.

> **Important:** OpenClaw currently defaults to `permissionMode=approve-reads` and `nonInteractivePermissions=fail`. In non-interactive ACP sessions, any write or exec that triggers a permission prompt can fail with `AcpRuntimeError: Permission prompt unavailable in non-interactive mode`.
>
> If you need to restrict permissions, set `nonInteractivePermissions` to `deny` so sessions degrade gracefully instead of crashing.
