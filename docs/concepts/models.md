A model ref (`provider/model`) chooses a provider and model, not the low-level
agent runtime. With runtime policy unset or `auto`, OpenAI's provider-owned
route policy may select Codex only for an exact official HTTPS Platform
Responses or ChatGPT Responses route with no authored request override; the
`openai/*` prefix alone never selects Codex. Completions adapters, custom
endpoints, and authored request behavior stay on OpenClaw. Plaintext official
HTTP endpoints are rejected. See [OpenAI implicit agent runtime](/providers/openai#implicit-agent-runtime).

Subscription Copilot refs (`github-copilot/*`) can be opted into the external
GitHub Copilot agent runtime plugin, but that path is always explicit (never
selected by `auto`). Runtime overrides belong on provider/model policy, not on
the whole agent or session. Runtime selection does not determine billing:
OpenAI API-key and ChatGPT/Codex subscription credentials remain distinct. See
[Agent runtimes](/concepts/agent-runtimes) and
[GitHub Copilot agent runtime](/plugins/copilot).

## Selection order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Primary model">
    `agents.defaults.model.primary` (or `agents.defaults.model` as a plain string).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fallbacks">
    `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`, tried in order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auth failover">
    Auth-profile rotation happens inside a provider before OpenClaw moves to the next fallback model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Related model-config surfaces:

- `agents.defaults.models` is the allowlist/catalog of models OpenClaw can use, plus aliases. Use `provider/*` entries to allow every discovered model from a provider without listing each one.
- `agents.defaults.utilityModel` is an optional lower-cost model for short internal tasks such as generated dashboard session titles, supported channel thread/topic titles, and progress narration. Per-agent `agents.list[].utilityModel` overrides it. When unset, OpenClaw uses the primary provider's declared small-model default when one exists (OpenAI → `gpt-5.6-luna`, Anthropic → `claude-haiku-4-5`), otherwise the agent's primary model; set it to an empty string to disable utility routing. Utility tasks are separate model calls and may send bounded task content to the selected model provider.
- `agents.defaults.imageModel` is used only when the primary model cannot accept images.
- `agents.defaults.pdfModel` is used by the `pdf` tool. If unset, the tool falls back to `imageModel`, then the resolved session/default model.
- `agents.defaults.imageGenerationModel`, `musicGenerationModel`, and `videoGenerationModel` back the shared media-generation tools. If unset, each tool infers an auth-backed provider default: current default provider first, then the remaining registered providers for that capability in provider-id order. Set `agents.defaults.mediaGenerationAutoProviderFallback: false` to disable that cross-provider inference while keeping explicit fallbacks.
- Per-agent `agents.list[].model` (plus bindings) overrides `agents.defaults.model` — see [Multi-agent routing](/concepts/multi-agent).

## Selection source and fallback strictness

The same `provider/model` behaves differently depending on where it came from:

| Source                                                                  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configured default (`agents.defaults.model.primary`, per-agent primary) | Normal starting point; uses `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Auto fallback                                                           | Temporary recovery state, stored as `modelOverrideSource: "auto"`. OpenClaw periodically reprobes the original primary, clears the auto selection on recovery, and announces fallback/recovery transitions once per state change.                              |
| User session selection                                                  | Exact and strict. `/model`, the model picker, `session_status(model=...)`, and `sessions.patch` store `modelOverrideSource: "user"`. If that provider/model becomes unreachable, the run fails visibly instead of falling through to another configured model. |
| Cron `--model` / payload `model`                                        | Per-job primary. Still uses configured fallbacks unless the job supplies its own payload `fallbacks` (`fallbacks: []` forces a strict run).                                                                                                                    |

Other selection rules:

- Changing `agents.defaults.model.primary` does not rewrite existing session pins. If status reports `This session is pinned to X; config primary Y will apply to new/unpinned sessions.`, run `/model default` to clear the pin.
- CLI default-model and allowlist pickers respect `models.mode: "replace"` by listing only `models.providers.*.models` instead of the full built-in catalog.
- The Control UI model picker asks the Gateway for its configured model view: `agents.defaults.models` when set (including `provider/*` wildcard entries), otherwise `models.providers.*.models` plus providers with usable auth. The full built-in catalog is reserved for explicit browse views (`models.list` with `view: "all"`, or `openclaw models list --all`).

Full mechanics: [Model failover](/concepts/model-failover).

## Quick model policy

- Set your primary to the strongest latest-generation model available to you.
- Use fallbacks for cost/latency-sensitive tasks and lower-stakes chat.
- For tool-enabled agents or untrusted inputs, avoid older/weaker model tiers.

## Onboarding

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Sets up model and auth for common providers without hand-editing config, including OpenAI Codex subscription OAuth and Anthropic (API key or Claude CLI reuse).

With no primary model configured, fresh OpenAI API-key setup selects
`openai/gpt-5.6`; the bare direct-API id resolves to the Sol tier. Fresh
ChatGPT/Codex OAuth setup selects the exact `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` catalog ref.
Reauthentication preserves an existing explicit primary model, including
`openai/gpt-5.5`. If GPT-5.6 is unavailable to the account, select
`openai/gpt-5.5` explicitly; OpenClaw does not silently downgrade it.

## "Model is not allowed" (and why replies stop)

If `agents.defaults.models` is set, it becomes the allowlist for `/model` and session overrides. Selecting a model outside that allowlist returns, before any normal reply is generated:

```text
Model "provider/model" is not allowed. Use /models to list providers, or /models <provider> to list models.
Add it with: openclaw config set agents.defaults.models '{"provider/model":{}}' --strict-json --merge
```

Fix it by adding the model to `agents.defaults.models`, clearing the allowlist entirely (remove the key), or picking a model from `/model list`. If the rejected command included a runtime override such as `/model openai/gpt-5.5 --runtime codex`, fix the allowlist first, then retry the same `/model ... --runtime ...` command.

For local/GGUF models, the allowlist needs the full provider-prefixed ref, for example `ollama/gemma4:26b` or `lmstudio/Gemma4-26b-a4-it-gguf` — check `openclaw models list --provider <provider>` for the exact string. Bare filenames or display names are not enough once the allowlist is active.

To limit providers without listing every model, use `provider/*` wildcard entries:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      models: {
        "openai/*": {},
        "vllm/*": {},
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`/model`, `/models`, and model pickers then show the discovered catalog for those providers only, and new models can appear without editing the allowlist. Mix exact `provider/model` entries with `provider/*` entries to pull in one specific model from another provider.

Example allowlist with aliases:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" },
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6": { alias: "Sonnet" },
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": { alias: "Opus" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<Accordion title="Safe allowlist edits from the CLI">
Use `--merge` for additive changes:

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.models '{"openai/gpt-5.4":{}}' --strict-json --merge
```

`openclaw config set` refuses plain-object assignments to `agents.defaults.models`, `models.providers`, or `models.providers.<id>.models` when they would drop existing entries; use `--replace` only when the new value should become the complete target value. Interactive provider setup and `openclaw configure --section model` already merge provider-scoped selections into the allowlist, so adding a provider does not drop unrelated entries; configure preserves an existing `agents.defaults.model.primary`. Explicit commands like `openclaw models auth login --provider <id> --set-default` and `openclaw models set <model>` still replace the primary.
</Accordion>

## `/model` in chat

```text
/model
/model list
/model 3
/model openai/gpt-5.4
/model default
/model status
```

- `/model` and `/model list` show a compact numbered picker (model family + available providers); `/model <#>` selects from it. On Discord this opens provider/model dropdowns with a Submit step; on Telegram, picker selections are session-scoped and never rewrite the agent's persistent default in `openclaw.json`. `/models add` is deprecated and returns a message instead of registering models from chat.
- `/model` persists the new session selection immediately. If the agent is idle, the next run uses it right away; if a run is already active, the switch is queued for the next clean retry point (or a later one, if tool activity or reply output already started).
- `/model default` clears the session selection so it inherits the configured primary again.
- A user-selected `/model` ref is strict for that session: if it becomes unreachable, the reply fails visibly instead of silently falling back through `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`. Configured defaults and cron job primaries still use fallback chains.
- `/model status` is the detailed view: auth candidates per provider, and (when configured) the provider endpoint `baseUrl` plus `api` mode.
- Model refs are parsed by splitting on the first `/`; type `provider/model`. If the model ID itself contains `/` (OpenRouter-style), include the provider prefix, e.g. `/model openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2`. If you omit the provider, OpenClaw tries: (1) alias match, (2) unique configured-provider match for that exact unprefixed model id, (3) the configured default provider (deprecated fallback) — and if that provider no longer exposes the configured default model, the first configured provider/model instead, to avoid surfacing a stale removed-provider default.
- Model refs are normalized to lowercase; provider IDs are otherwise exact, so use the ID advertised by the plugin.

## CLI

```bash
openclaw models status
openclaw models list
openclaw models set <provider/model>
openclaw models set-image <provider/model>
openclaw models scan
openclaw models aliases list|add|remove
openclaw models fallbacks list|add|remove|clear
openclaw models image-fallbacks list|add|remove|clear
openclaw models auth list|add|login|paste-api-key|paste-token|setup-token|order
```

`openclaw models` with no subcommand is a shortcut for `models status`, which also surfaces OAuth expiry for auth-store profiles (warns within 24h by default). Full flags, JSON shapes, and auth-profile subcommands: [Models CLI reference](/cli/models).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scanning (OpenRouter free models)">
    `openclaw models scan` inspects OpenRouter's public free-model catalog and can probe candidates for tool and image support live. The catalog itself is public, so metadata-only scans (`--no-probe`) need no key; live probing and `--set-default`/`--set-image` require an OpenRouter API key (auth profile or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and fail closed to metadata-only output without one.

    Results rank by: image support, then tool latency, then context size, then parameter count. In a TTY, probed results prompt an interactive fallback selection; non-interactive mode needs `--yes` to accept defaults.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Models registry (`models.json`)

Custom providers configured under `models.providers` are written into `models.json` under the agent directory (default `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/models.json`). Provider-plugin catalogs are stored separately as generated plugin-owned catalog shards and load automatically. This file is merged with config by default; set `models.mode: "replace"` to use only your configured providers.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Merge mode precedence">
    For matching provider IDs:

    - A non-empty `baseUrl` already present in the agent `models.json` wins.
    - A non-empty `apiKey` in `models.json` wins only when that provider is not SecretRef-managed in the current config/auth-profile context.
    - SecretRef-managed `apiKey` values refresh from source markers instead of persisting resolved secrets: the env variable name for env refs, `secretref-managed` for file/exec refs.
    - SecretRef-managed header values refresh the same way, using `secretref-env:ENV_VAR_NAME` for env refs.
    - Empty or missing `apiKey`/`baseUrl` in `models.json` fall back to config `models.providers`.
    - Other provider fields refresh from config and normalized catalog data.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Marker persistence is source-authoritative: OpenClaw writes markers from the active source config snapshot (pre-resolution), not from resolved runtime secret values, whenever it regenerates `models.json` — including command-driven paths like `openclaw agent`.
