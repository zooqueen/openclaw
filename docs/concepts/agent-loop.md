title: "Agent loop"
---

The agent loop is the serialized, per-session run that turns a message into
actions and a reply: intake, context assembly, model inference, tool
execution, streaming, persistence.

## Entry points

- Gateway RPC: `agent` and `agent.wait`.
- CLI: `openclaw agent`.

## Run sequence

1. `agent` RPC validates params, resolves the session (`sessionKey`/`sessionId`), persists session metadata, and returns `{ runId, acceptedAt }` immediately.
2. `agentCommand` runs the turn: resolves model + thinking/verbose/trace defaults, loads the skills snapshot, calls `runEmbeddedAgent`, and emits a fallback **lifecycle end/error** if the embedded loop did not already emit one.
3. `runEmbeddedAgent`: serializes runs via per-session and global queues, resolves model + auth profile, builds the OpenClaw session, subscribes to runtime events, streams assistant/tool deltas, enforces the run timeout (aborting on expiry), and returns payloads plus usage metadata. For Codex app-server turns it also aborts an accepted turn that stops producing app-server progress before a terminal event.
4. `subscribeEmbeddedAgentSession` bridges runtime events to the `agent` stream: tool events to `stream: "tool"`, assistant deltas to `stream: "assistant"`, lifecycle events to `stream: "lifecycle"` (`phase: "start" | "end" | "error"`).
5. `agent.wait` (`waitForAgentRun`) waits for **lifecycle end/error** on a `runId` and returns `{ status: ok|error|timeout, startedAt, endedAt, error? }`.

## Queueing and concurrency

Runs are serialized per session key (session lane) and optionally through a global lane, preventing tool/session races. Messaging channels choose a queue mode (steer/followup/collect/interrupt) that feeds this lane system; see [Command Queue](/concepts/queue).

Transcript writes are additionally protected by a session write lock on the session file. The lock is process-aware and file-based, so it catches writers that bypass the in-process queue or come from another process. Writers wait up to `session.writeLock.acquireTimeoutMs` (default `60000` ms; env override `OPENCLAW_SESSION_WRITE_LOCK_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS`) before reporting the session as busy.

Session write locks are non-reentrant by default. A helper that intentionally nests acquisition of the same lock while preserving one logical writer must opt in with `allowReentrant: true`.

## Session and workspace preparation

- Workspace is resolved and created; sandboxed runs may redirect to a sandbox workspace root.
- Skills are loaded (or reused from a snapshot) and injected into env and prompt.
- Bootstrap/context files are resolved and injected into the system prompt.
- A session write lock is acquired and `SessionManager` is opened and prepared before streaming starts. Any later transcript rewrite, compaction, or truncation path must take the same lock before opening or mutating the transcript file.

## Prompt assembly

System prompt is built from OpenClaw's base prompt, skills prompt, bootstrap context, and per-run overrides. Model-specific limits and compaction reserve tokens are enforced. See [System prompt](/concepts/system-prompt) for what the model sees.

## Hooks

OpenClaw has two hook systems:

- **Internal hooks** (Gateway hooks): event-driven scripts for commands and lifecycle events.
- **Plugin hooks**: extension points inside the agent/tool lifecycle and gateway pipeline.

### Internal hooks (Gateway hooks)

- **`agent:bootstrap`**: runs while building bootstrap files before the system prompt is finalized. Use it to add or remove bootstrap context files.
- **Command hooks**: `/new`, `/reset`, `/stop`, and other command events (see the Hooks doc).

See [Hooks](/automation/hooks) for setup and examples.

### Plugin hooks

These run inside the agent loop or gateway pipeline:

Hook decision rules for outbound/tool guards:

- `before_tool_call`: `{ block: true }` is terminal and stops lower-priority handlers. `{ block: false }` is a no-op and does not clear a prior block.
- `before_install`: same terminal/no-op semantics as above. Use `security.installPolicy`, not `before_install`, for operator-owned install allow/block decisions that must cover CLI install and update paths.
- `message_sending`: `{ cancel: true }` is terminal and stops lower-priority handlers. `{ cancel: false }` is a no-op and does not clear a prior cancel.

See [Plugin hooks](/plugins/hooks) for the hook API and registration details.

Harnesses can adapt these hooks. The Codex app-server harness keeps OpenClaw plugin hooks as the compatibility contract for documented mirrored surfaces; Codex native hooks are a separate, lower-level Codex mechanism.

## Streaming

- Assistant deltas stream from the agent runtime as `assistant` events.
- Block streaming can emit partial replies on `text_end` or `message_end`.
- Reasoning streaming can be a separate stream or block replies.
- See [Streaming](/concepts/streaming) for chunking and block reply behavior.

## Tool execution

- Tool start/update/end events emit on the `tool` stream.
- Tool results are sanitized for size and image payloads before logging/emitting.
- Messaging tool sends are tracked to suppress duplicate assistant confirmations.

## Reply shaping

Final payloads are assembled from assistant text (plus optional reasoning), inline tool summaries (when verbose and allowed), and assistant error text when the model errors.

- The exact silent token `NO_REPLY` is filtered from outgoing payloads.
- Messaging tool duplicates are removed from the final payload list.
- If no renderable payloads remain and a tool errored, a fallback tool error reply is emitted unless a messaging tool already sent a user-visible reply.

## Compaction and retries

Auto-compaction emits `compaction` stream events and can trigger a retry. On retry, in-memory buffers and tool summaries reset to avoid duplicate output. See [Compaction](/concepts/compaction).

## Event streams

- `lifecycle`: emitted by `subscribeEmbeddedAgentSession` (and as a fallback by `agentCommand`).
- `assistant`: streamed deltas from the agent runtime.
- `tool`: streamed tool events from the agent runtime.

## Chat channel handling

Assistant deltas buffer into chat `delta` messages. A chat `final` is emitted on **lifecycle end/error**.

| Model idle timeout                               | `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds`, capped at 120s by default | OpenClaw aborts a model request when no response chunks arrive before the idle window. `models.providers.<id>.timeoutSeconds` extends this idle watchdog for slow local/self-hosted providers, but stays bounded by any lower `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` or run-specific timeout, since those govern the whole agent run. Cron-triggered cloud model runs with no explicit model/agent timeout use the same default; with an explicit cron run timeout, cloud model stream stalls cap at 60s so configured model fallbacks can still run before the outer cron deadline. Cron-triggered local/self-hosted model runs disable the implicit watchdog unless an explicit timeout is configured; set `models.providers.<id>.timeoutSeconds` for slow local providers. |
| Provider HTTP request timeout                    | `models.providers.<id>.timeoutSeconds`                      | Covers connect, headers, body, SDK request timeout, guarded-fetch abort handling, and the model stream idle watchdog for that provider. Use for slow local/self-hosted providers (for example Ollama) before raising the whole agent runtime timeout; keep the agent/runtime timeout at least as high when the model request needs to run longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Stuck session diagnostics

With diagnostics enabled, `diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs` (default `120000` ms) classifies long `processing` sessions with no observed reply, tool, status, block, or ACP progress:

- Active embedded runs, model calls, and tool calls report as `session.long_running`. Owned silent model calls stay `session.long_running` until `diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs` so slow or non-streaming providers are not flagged as stalled too early.
- Active work with no recent progress reports as `session.stalled`. Owned model calls switch to `session.stalled` at or after the abort threshold; ownerless stale model/tool activity is not hidden as long-running.
- `session.stuck` is reserved for recoverable stale session bookkeeping, including idle queued sessions with stale ownerless model/tool activity.

`diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs` defaults to at least 5 minutes and 3x the warn threshold. Stale session bookkeeping releases the affected session lane immediately after recovery gates pass; stalled embedded runs are abort-drained only after the abort threshold, so queued work resumes without cutting off merely slow runs. Recovery emits structured requested/completed outcomes; diagnostic state is marked idle only if the same processing generation is still current, and repeated `session.stuck` diagnostics back off while the session stays unchanged.

## Where things can end early

- Agent timeout (abort)
- AbortSignal (cancel)
- Gateway disconnect or RPC timeout
- `agent.wait` timeout (wait-only, does not stop the agent)
