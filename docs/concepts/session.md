OpenClaw organizes conversations into **sessions**. Each message is routed to a
session based on where it came from -- DMs, group chats, cron jobs, etc.

## How messages are routed

| Source          | Behavior                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Direct messages | Shared session by default |
| Group chats     | Isolated per group        |
| Rooms/channels  | Isolated per room         |
| Cron jobs       | Fresh session per run     |
| Webhooks        | Isolated per hook         |

## DM isolation

By default, all DMs share one session for continuity. This is fine for
single-user setups.

<Warning>
If multiple people can message your agent, enable DM isolation. Without it, all
users share the same conversation context -- Alice's private messages would be
visible to Bob.
</Warning>

**The fix:**

```json5
{
  session: {
    dmScope: "per-channel-peer", // isolate by channel + sender
  },
}
```

Other options:

- `main` (default) -- all DMs share one session.
- `per-peer` -- isolate by sender (across channels).
- `per-channel-peer` -- isolate by channel + sender (recommended).
- `per-account-channel-peer` -- isolate by account + channel + sender.

<Tip>
If the same person contacts you from multiple channels, use
`session.identityLinks` to link their identities so they share one session.
</Tip>

### Dock linked channels

Dock commands let a user move the current direct-chat session's reply route to
another linked channel without starting a new session. See
[Channel docking](/concepts/channel-docking) for examples, config, and
troubleshooting.

Verify your setup with `openclaw security audit`.

## Session lifecycle

Sessions are reused until they expire:

- **Daily reset** (default) -- new session at 4:00 AM local time on the gateway
  host. Daily freshness is based on when the current `sessionId` started, not
  on later metadata writes.
- **Idle reset** (optional) -- new session after a period of inactivity. Set
  `session.reset.idleMinutes`. Idle freshness is based on the last real
  user/channel interaction, so heartbeat, cron, and exec system events do not
  keep the session alive.
- **Manual reset** -- type `/new` or `/reset` in chat. `/new <model>` also
  switches the model.

When both daily and idle resets are configured, whichever expires first wins.
Heartbeat, cron, exec, and other system-event turns may write session metadata,
but those writes do not extend daily or idle reset freshness. When a reset
rolls the session, queued system-event notices for the old session are
discarded so stale background updates are not prepended to the first prompt in
the new session.

Sessions with an active provider-owned CLI session are not cut by the implicit
daily default. Use `/reset` or configure `session.reset` explicitly when those
sessions should expire on a timer.

## Where state lives

All session state is owned by the **gateway**. UI clients query the gateway for
session data.

- **Store:** `~/.openclaw/state/openclaw.sqlite` for global state plus `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite` for agent-owned rows. Legacy `sessions.json` indexes are imported by `openclaw doctor --fix`.
- **Transcripts:** SQLite `transcript_events` rows in the per-agent database.
  JSONL transcript files are legacy doctor-import input only; runtime code must
  not create, select, or bridge through transcript files or locators.

The session store keeps separate lifecycle timestamps:

- `sessionStartedAt`: when the current `sessionId` began; daily reset uses this.
- `lastInteractionAt`: last user/channel interaction that extends idle lifetime.
- `updatedAt`: last store-row mutation; useful for listing, but not
  authoritative for daily/idle reset freshness.

Older rows without `sessionStartedAt` are resolved from the SQLite transcript
session header when available. If an older row also lacks `lastInteractionAt`,
idle freshness falls back to that session start time, not to later bookkeeping
writes.

## Session Repair

SQLite is the durable session store. Gateway runtime writes do not prune, cap,
or import session rows, and session store reads do not run cleanup during
startup. Legacy `session.maintenance` settings are handled only by
`openclaw doctor --fix`, which removes them from older config files.

Use `openclaw doctor --fix` to import remaining legacy session files into
SQLite. If a migrated row still lacks corresponding SQLite transcript rows after
doctor runs, reset or delete that session explicitly.

## Inspecting sessions

- `openclaw status` -- agent database path and recent activity.
- `openclaw sessions --json` -- all sessions (filter with `--active <minutes>`).
- `/status` in chat -- context usage, model, and toggles.
- `/context list` -- what is in the system prompt.
