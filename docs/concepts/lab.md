# Lab

Lab is OpenClaw's **experimental feature umbrella** for repo-owned agent
behavior experiments.

Right now, the first Lab feature is **custom overrides**:

- a model-level `AGENTS.md` addendum
- an optional higher-priority agent-specific `AGENTS.md` addendum
- a non-runtime `defaults/` folder for shipped reference material

Lab is intentionally separate from stable config because this surface is still
changing. Use it when you want to tune agent behavior without pretending the
contract is already permanent.

## Commands

Use the Lab command menu from chat:

```txt
/lab
/lab custom status
/lab enable custom
/lab disable custom
```

Notes:

- `/lab` is the entry point and shows the currently available Lab features.
- `custom` is the current feature key.
- the user-facing name is **custom overrides**
- the stored config path is still:

```toml
[plugins.entries.lab.config.modelOverrides]
enabled = true
```

## What custom overrides do

When custom overrides are enabled, OpenClaw can inject extra `AGENTS.md`
instructions from the workspace into the system prompt.

Live files:

```txt
<workspace>/.openclaw/lab/overrides/<model-id>/AGENTS.md
<workspace>/.openclaw/lab/agents/<agent-id>/overrides/<model-id>/AGENTS.md
```

Instructional-only files:

```txt
<workspace>/.openclaw/lab/overrides/<model-id>/defaults/*.md
```

`defaults/` does **not** load into the system prompt. It exists so users have a
safe place to start from when copying or tuning their own live overrides.

See [Custom Overrides](/concepts/lab-custom-overrides) for the full path and
precedence rules.

## Current prompt order

For the GPT-5.4 Lab path that ships in this repo, prompt ordering is:

```txt
1. Lab model addendum
2. Lab agent addendum
3. root AGENTS.md
4. other prompt/context files
5. FINAL_REMINDER.md
```

That means Lab addenda are a **higher-priority overlay** on top of the normal
repo `AGENTS.md`.

Lab addenda are also treated like normal prompt files for:

- prompt reporting
- truncation
- context budgeting

They are not a hidden side channel.

## Status and debugging

`/lab custom status` reports:

- whether the Lab plugin is enabled
- whether custom overrides are enabled
- current model
- current agent
- resolved workspace
- exact override paths checked
- active addenda
- whether any active addendum was truncated

That output is the fastest way to debug “why is my override not loading?”

## Scope and expectations

Lab is for **experiments**. That means:

- commands and feature names may change faster than stable config
- prompt file structure may evolve
- docs should describe the current shipped behavior, not promise a long-term API

If you want stable workspace customization, keep using the normal workspace
files (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, etc.). Use Lab when you want an
explicit experimental overlay.
