## What it does

When audio understanding is enabled (or auto-detected), OpenClaw:

1. Locates the first audio attachment (local path or URL) and downloads it if needed.
2. Enforces `maxBytes` before sending to each model entry.
3. Runs the first eligible model entry in order (provider or CLI); if an entry fails or skips (size/timeout), the next entry is tried.
4. On success, replaces `Body` with an `[Audio]` block and sets `{{Transcript}}`.

When transcription succeeds, `CommandBody`/`RawBody` are also set to the transcript so slash commands still work. With `--verbose`, logs show when transcription runs and when it replaces the body.

## Auto-detection (default)

If you have not configured models and `tools.media.audio.enabled` is not `false`, OpenClaw auto-detects in this order and stops at the first working option:

1. **Active reply model**, when its provider supports audio understanding.
2. **Configured provider auth** — any `models.providers.*` entry with auth available for a provider that supports audio transcription. This is checked before local CLIs, so a configured API key always wins over a local binary on `PATH`.
   Provider priority when multiple are configured: Groq, OpenAI, xAI, Deepgram, Google, SenseAudio, ElevenLabs, Mistral.
3. **Local CLIs** (only if no provider auth resolved), checked in this order:
   - `sherpa-onnx-offline` (requires `SHERPA_ONNX_MODEL_DIR` with `tokens.txt`, `encoder.onnx`, `decoder.onnx`, and `joiner.onnx`)
   - `whisper-cli` (from `whisper-cpp`; uses `WHISPER_CPP_MODEL` or a bundled tiny model)
   - `whisper` (Python CLI; downloads models automatically)

Gemini CLI auto-detect for media understanding was replaced by a sandboxed Antigravity CLI (`agy`) fallback for image/video; audio does not use a CLI fallback beyond the local binaries above.

To disable auto-detection, set `tools.media.audio.enabled: false`. To customize, set `tools.media.audio.models`.

<Note>
Binary detection is best-effort across macOS/Linux/Windows. Make sure the CLI is on `PATH` (`~` is expanded), or set an explicit CLI model with a full command path.

## Config examples

### Provider + CLI fallback (OpenAI + Whisper CLI)

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        maxBytes: 20971520,
        models: [
          { provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-transcribe" },
          {
            type: "cli",
            command: "whisper",
            args: ["--model", "base", "{{MediaPath}}"],
            timeoutSeconds: 45,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Provider-only with scope gating

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        scope: {
          default: "allow",
          rules: [{ action: "deny", match: { chatType: "group" } }],
        },
        models: [{ provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-transcribe" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Provider-only (Deepgram)

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        models: [{ provider: "deepgram", model: "nova-3" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Provider-only (Mistral Voxtral)

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        models: [{ provider: "mistral", model: "voxtral-mini-latest" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Provider-only (SenseAudio)

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        models: [{ provider: "senseaudio", model: "senseaudio-asr-pro-1.5-260319" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Echo transcript to chat (opt-in)

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        echoTranscript: true, // default is false
        echoFormat: '📝 "{transcript}"', // optional, supports {transcript}
        models: [{ provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-transcribe" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Notes and limits

- Provider auth follows the standard model auth order (auth profiles, env vars, `models.providers.*.apiKey`).
- Groq setup details: [Groq](/providers/groq).
- Deepgram picks up `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` when `provider: "deepgram"` is used. Setup details: [Deepgram](/providers/deepgram).
- Mistral setup details: [Mistral](/providers/mistral).
- SenseAudio picks up `SENSEAUDIO_API_KEY` when `provider: "senseaudio"` is used. Setup details: [SenseAudio](/providers/senseaudio).
- Audio providers can override `baseUrl`, `headers`, and `providerOptions` via `tools.media.audio`.
- Default size cap is 20MB (`tools.media.audio.maxBytes`). Oversize audio is skipped for that model and the next entry is tried.
- Audio files below 1024 bytes are skipped before provider/CLI transcription.
- Default `maxChars` for audio is **unset** (full transcript). Set `tools.media.audio.maxChars` or a per-entry `maxChars` to trim output.
- OpenAI auto-detect default is `gpt-4o-transcribe`; set `model: "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"` for a cheaper/faster option.
- Use `tools.media.audio.attachments` to process multiple voice notes (`mode: "all"` plus `maxAttachments`, default 1).
- Transcript is available to templates as `{{Transcript}}`.
- `tools.media.audio.echoTranscript` is off by default; enable it to send a transcript confirmation back to the originating chat before agent processing.
- `tools.media.audio.echoFormat` customizes the echo text (placeholder: `{transcript}`; default `📝 "{transcript}"`).
- CLI stdout is capped at 5MB; keep CLI output concise.
- CLI `args` should use `{{MediaPath}}` for the local audio file path. Run `openclaw doctor --fix` to migrate deprecated `{input}` placeholders from older `audio.transcription.command` configs (retired key: `audio.transcription`, replaced by `tools.media.audio.models`).

### Proxy environment support

Provider-based audio transcription honors standard outbound proxy env vars, matching undici's `EnvHttpProxyAgent` semantics:

- `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
- `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
- `ALL_PROXY` / `all_proxy`

Lowercase variables take precedence over uppercase; `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` entries (hostnames, `*.suffix`, or `host:port`) bypass the proxy. If no proxy env vars are set, direct egress is used. If proxy setup fails (malformed URL), OpenClaw logs a warning and falls back to direct fetch.

## Mention detection in groups

When `requireMention: true` is set for a group chat, OpenClaw transcribes audio **before** checking for mentions. This lets voice notes pass the mention gate even when the message has no text body.

**How it works:**

1. If a voice message has no text body and the group requires mentions, OpenClaw performs a preflight transcription of the first audio attachment.
2. The transcript is checked for mention patterns (for example `@BotName`, emoji triggers).
3. If a mention is found, the message proceeds through the full reply pipeline.

**Fallback behavior:** if preflight transcription fails (timeout, API error, etc.), the message falls back to text-only mention detection so mixed messages (text + audio) are never dropped.

**Opt-out per Telegram group/topic:**

- Set `channels.telegram.groups.<chatId>.disableAudioPreflight: true` to skip preflight transcript mention checks for that group.
- Set `channels.telegram.groups.<chatId>.topics.<threadId>.disableAudioPreflight` to override per-topic (`true` to skip, `false` to force-enable).
- Default is `false` (preflight enabled when mention-gated conditions match).

**Example:** a user sends a voice note saying "Hey @Claude, what's the weather?" in a Telegram group with `requireMention: true`. The voice note is transcribed, the mention is detected, and the agent replies.

## Gotchas

- Scope rules use first-match-wins; `chatType` is normalized to `direct`, `group`, or `channel`.
- Ensure your CLI exits 0 and prints plain text; JSON output needs to be massaged via `jq -r .text`.
- For `parakeet-mlx`, if you pass `--output-dir`, OpenClaw reads `<output-dir>/<media-basename>.txt` when `--output-format` is `txt` (or omitted); non-`txt` output formats fall back to stdout parsing.
- Keep timeouts reasonable (`timeoutSeconds`, default 60s) to avoid blocking the reply queue.
- Preflight transcription only processes the **first** audio attachment for mention detection. Additional audio attachments are processed during the main media-understanding phase.
