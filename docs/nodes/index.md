title: "Nodes"

A **node** is a companion device (macOS/iOS/watchOS/Android/headless) that connects to the Gateway with `role: "node"` and exposes a command surface (e.g. `canvas.*`, `camera.*`, `device.*`, `notifications.*`, `system.*`) via `node.invoke`. Most nodes use the Gateway WebSocket on the operator port. The optional direct Apple Watch node uses signed HTTPS polling on that same port because watchOS blocks generic low-level networking for ordinary apps. Protocol details: [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol).

Legacy transport: [Bridge protocol](/gateway/bridge-protocol) (TCP JSONL; historical only for current nodes).

macOS can also run in **node mode**: the menubar app connects to the Gateway's WS server and exposes its local canvas/camera commands as a node (so `openclaw nodes …` works against this Mac). In remote gateway mode, browser automation is handled by the CLI node host (`openclaw node run` or the installed node service), not by the native app node.

Nodes are **peripherals**, not gateways: they don't run the gateway service, and channel messages (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.) land on the gateway, not on nodes.

Troubleshooting runbook: [/nodes/troubleshooting](/nodes/troubleshooting)

## Pairing + status

Nodes use **device pairing**. A node presents a signed device identity during connect; the Gateway creates a device pairing request for `role: node`. Approve via the devices CLI (or UI). The direct Apple Watch setup uses an admin-minted, short-lived node-only setup code to approve its fixed low-risk command surface; later capability expansion still requires normal approval.

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
openclaw devices reject <requestId>
openclaw nodes status
openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
```

Pending pairing requests expire 5 minutes after the device's last retry — a device that keeps reconnecting keeps its one pending request (and `requestId`) alive instead of minting a new prompt every few minutes; see [Node pairing](/gateway/pairing) for the full request/approve lifecycle. If a node retries with changed auth details (role/scopes/public key), the prior pending request is superseded and a new `requestId` is created — clients get a `device.pair.resolved` event for the superseded request, and you should re-run `openclaw devices list` before approving.

- `nodes status` marks a node as **paired** when its device pairing role includes `node`.
- The device pairing record is the durable approved-role contract. Token rotation stays inside that contract; it cannot upgrade a paired node into a role that pairing approval never granted.
- `node.pair.*` (CLI: `openclaw nodes pending/approve/reject/remove/rename`) is a separate, gateway-owned node pairing store that tracks the node's approved command/capability surface across reconnects. It does **not** gate transport authentication — device pairing does that.
- `openclaw nodes remove --node <id|name|ip>` removes a node pairing. For a device-backed node it revokes the device's `node` role in the paired-device store and disconnects that device's node-role sessions: a mixed-role device keeps its row and only loses the `node` role, while a node-only device row is deleted. It also clears any matching entry from the separate node pairing store. `operator.pairing` may remove non-operator node rows on other devices; a device-token caller revoking its own node role on a mixed-role device additionally needs `operator.admin`.
- Approval scope follows the pending request's declared commands:
  - commandless request: `operator.pairing`
  - non-exec node commands: `operator.pairing` + `operator.write`
  - `system.run` / `system.run.prepare` / `system.which`: `operator.pairing` + `operator.admin`

## Version skew and upgrade order

The Gateway WebSocket accepts authenticated node clients across an N-1 protocol window.
The current v4 Gateway therefore accepts v3 nodes when the connection declares
both `role: "node"` and `client.mode: "node"`. Operator and UI sessions must
still use the current protocol.

For staged fleet upgrades, upgrade the Gateway first, then upgrade each node.
An N-1 node remains visible and manageable while it is upgraded; the Gateway
logs `legacy node protocol accepted` with an upgrade recommendation. Pairing,
device authentication, command allowlists, and exec approvals still apply.
Plugin-owned capabilities and commands stay hidden until the node upgrades to
the current protocol. Nodes older than N-1 require an out-of-band upgrade before
reconnecting.

The direct watchOS HTTPS transport requires the current protocol version; update
the watch app with the Gateway before enabling direct mode.

## Remote node host (system.run)

Use a **node host** when your Gateway runs on one machine and you want commands to execute on another. The model still talks to the **gateway**; the gateway forwards `exec` calls to the **node host** when `host=node` is selected.

| Role         | Responsibility                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gateway host | Receives messages, runs the model, routes tool calls.            |
| Node host    | Executes `system.run`/`system.which` on the node machine.        |
| Approvals    | Enforced on the node host via `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`. |

Approval note:

- Approval-backed node runs bind exact request context. The exec path prepares a canonical `systemRunPlan` before approval; once granted, the gateway forwards that stored plan, not any later caller-edited command/cwd/session fields, and re-validates the working directory before running.
- For direct shell/runtime file executions, OpenClaw also best-effort binds one concrete local file operand and denies the run if that file changes before execution.
- If OpenClaw cannot identify exactly one concrete local file for an interpreter/runtime command, approval-backed execution is denied instead of pretending full runtime coverage. Use sandboxing, separate hosts, or an explicit trusted allowlist/full workflow for broader interpreter semantics.

### Start a node host (foreground)

On the node machine:

```bash
openclaw node run --host <gateway-host> --port 18789 --display-name "Build Node"
```

`node run` also accepts `--context-path` (Gateway WS context path), `--tls`, `--tls-fingerprint <sha256>`, and `--node-id` (override the legacy client instance ID; this does not reset pairing).

### Remote gateway via SSH tunnel (loopback bind)

If the Gateway binds to loopback (`gateway.bind=loopback`, default in local mode), remote node hosts cannot connect directly. Create an SSH tunnel and point the node host at the local end of the tunnel.

Example (node host -> gateway host):

```bash
# Terminal A (keep running): forward local 18790 -> gateway 127.0.0.1:18789
ssh -N -L 18790:127.0.0.1:18789 user@gateway-host

# Terminal B: export the gateway token and connect through the tunnel
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="<gateway-token>"
openclaw node run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18790 --display-name "Build Node"
```

Notes:

- `openclaw node run` supports token or password auth.
- Env vars are preferred: `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`.
- Config fallback is `gateway.auth.token` / `gateway.auth.password`.
- In local mode, node host intentionally ignores `gateway.remote.token` / `gateway.remote.password`.
- In remote mode, `gateway.remote.token` / `gateway.remote.password` are eligible per remote precedence rules.
- If active local `gateway.auth.*` SecretRefs are configured but unresolved, node-host auth fails closed.
- Node-host auth resolution only honors `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_*` env vars.

### Start a node host (service)

```bash
openclaw node install --host <gateway-host> --port 18789 --display-name "Build Node"
openclaw node start
openclaw node restart
```

`node install` also accepts `--context-path`, `--tls`, `--tls-fingerprint`, `--node-id` (legacy client instance ID only), `--runtime <node|bun>` (default: node), and `--force` to reinstall. `node status`, `node stop`, and `node uninstall` are also available.

### Pair + name

On the gateway host:

```bash
openclaw devices list
openclaw devices approve <requestId>
openclaw nodes status
```

If the node retries with changed auth details, re-run `openclaw devices list` and approve the current `requestId`.

Naming options:

- `--display-name` on `openclaw node run` / `openclaw node install` (persists in `~/.openclaw/node.json` on the node, alongside the client instance ID and Gateway connection metadata).
- `openclaw nodes rename --node <id|name|ip> --name "Build Node"` (gateway override).

### Node-hosted MCP servers

Configure MCP servers in `openclaw.json` on the node machine, not on the
Gateway:

```json5
{
  nodeHost: {
    mcp: {
      servers: {
        localDocs: {
          command: "npx",
          args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/srv/docs"],
          toolFilter: {
            include: ["read_*", "search"],
          },
        },
        internalApi: {
          url: "https://mcp.internal.example/mcp",
          transport: "streamable-http",
          headers: {
            Authorization: "Bearer ${INTERNAL_MCP_TOKEN}",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The headless node host starts these servers, lists their tools, and publishes
the descriptors after connecting. Tool calls return to that node through
`mcp.tools.call.v1`; the Gateway does not need matching MCP config or a JS
plugin. OAuth MCP servers are not supported by this node-hosted v1 path.

Current node hosts declare the built-in `mcp.tools.call.v1` command family during
their initial pairing even when no MCP server is configured. A node paired on an
older OpenClaw version may request a one-time command-surface upgrade after the
node host is updated. Adding, removing, or filtering servers after that does not
require re-pairing because the approved command family is unchanged. Restart
`openclaw node run` or `openclaw node restart` to apply node MCP config changes;
the node host does not watch this config.

Gateway operators can ignore all agent-visible tools published by paired nodes,
including node-hosted MCP tools, with
`gateway.nodes.pluginTools.enabled: false`. Exact command denies such as
`gateway.nodes.denyCommands: ["mcp.tools.call.v1"]` also block execution.

### Node-hosted skills

Install skills under the node machine's active OpenClaw skills directory,
`~/.openclaw/skills` by default. `OPENCLAW_HOME`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, and
`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` move that active profile. `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` takes
precedence for skills; otherwise, `skills/` is beside the path printed by
`openclaw config file`. The headless node host publishes valid `SKILL.md` files
after it connects, and the Gateway adds them to agent skill snapshots only while
that node remains connected. Each skill directory name must match the `name`
frontmatter field so the abstract node locator maps to one entry without adding
another protocol field.

The initial node-role pairing approves skill publication. Adding, removing, or
changing skills does not require another pairing or Gateway configuration
change. Restart `openclaw node run` or `openclaw node restart` after changing
node skill files; the node host does not watch the skills directory.

Node-hosted skill entries identify their node and carry their execution
location. Skill files, referenced relative paths, and binaries remain on that
node. Load instructions and run commands with
`exec host=node node=<node-id>` so relative paths resolve on the node rather
than the Gateway machine. The publishing node must have approved `system.run`,
and the agent's exec policy must allow `host=node`; otherwise the skill stays
out of that agent's snapshot.

Set `nodeHost.skills.enabled: false` on the node to stop publication. Gateway
operators can ignore skills from every paired node with
`gateway.nodes.skills.enabled: false`.

### Headless identity state

The headless node keeps three separate state files:

- `~/.openclaw/node.json`: the legacy client instance ID (stored as `nodeId`), display name, and Gateway connection metadata.
- `~/.openclaw/identity/device.json`: the signed device keypair and derived cryptographic device ID.
- `~/.openclaw/identity/device-auth.json`: paired device auth tokens keyed by cryptographic device ID and role.

For a signed node, the Gateway uses the cryptographic device ID for pairing and
node routing. The client instance ID is only connection metadata. Changing
`--node-id` or deleting only `node.json` therefore does not reset pairing. See
[Identity and pairing state](/cli/node#identity-and-pairing-state) for the
supported revoke-and-re-pair flow and upgrade notes.

### Allowlist the commands

Exec approvals are **per node host**. Add allowlist entries from the gateway:

```bash
openclaw approvals allowlist add --node <id|name|ip> "/usr/bin/uname"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --node <id|name|ip> "/usr/bin/sw_vers"
```

Approvals live on the node host at `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`.

### Point exec at the node

Configure defaults (gateway config):

```bash
openclaw config set tools.exec.host node
openclaw config set tools.exec.security allowlist
openclaw config set tools.exec.node "<id-or-name>"
```

Or per session:

```text
/exec host=node security=allowlist node=<id-or-name>
```

Once set, any `exec` call with `host=node` runs on the node host (subject to the node allowlist/approvals).

`host=auto` will not implicitly choose the node on its own, but an explicit per-call `host=node` request is allowed from `auto`. If you want node exec to be the default for the session, set `tools.exec.host=node` or `/exec host=node ...` explicitly.

### Local model inference

A desktop or server node can expose chat-capable models from an Ollama server running on that node. Agents use the Ollama plugin's `node_inference` tool to discover installed models and run a bounded prompt remotely; the Gateway does not need direct network access to Ollama. See [Ollama node-local inference](/providers/ollama#node-local-inference) for setup, model filtering, and direct verification commands.

### Codex sessions and transcripts

The official `codex` plugin can expose non-archived Codex sessions on a
headless node host or native macOS node. Catalog registration no longer depends
on `supervision.enabled`; that option gates the agent-facing supervision tools.
The plugin must still be active on both computers, and the node setting remains
local consent: enabling only the Gateway cannot read another computer's Codex
state.

The node advertises the versioned read-only
`codex.appServer.threads.list.v1` and
`codex.appServer.thread.turns.list.v1` commands. Approve the node pairing
upgrade when those commands first appear. The Gateway invokes them through the
normal plugin node policy and isolates failures by host.

Paired-node rows appear as a **Codex** group in the normal sessions sidebar.
Selecting a row opens the normal Chat pane and reads its persisted transcript
through bounded, cursor-paginated
`thread/turns/list` calls with full item projection. The node invoke transport is request/response only and cannot
carry the streaming turns, live events, or approvals required to continue a
native thread through the Codex harness. **Continue** and **Archive** are
therefore unavailable for remote rows. On the Gateway computer, stored and idle
rows can start a distinct model-locked Chat branch. Either can be archived only
after the operator confirms that no other Codex client is using it; a stored
row's live activity remains unknown. Active rows cannot branch or archive.

See [Supervise Codex sessions](/plugins/codex-supervision) for setup,
pagination, local continuation, and the metadata security boundary.

### Claude sessions and transcripts

The bundled `anthropic` plugin discovers non-archived Claude CLI and Claude
Desktop sessions on the Gateway and paired nodes. Unlike Codex supervision,
this needs no separate opt-in: a remote macOS app node advertises
`anthropic.claude.sessions.list.v1` and `anthropic.claude.sessions.read.v1`
when the Anthropic plugin is enabled and `~/.claude/projects/` exists. Approve
the node pairing upgrade when those commands first appear.

The catalog combines valid Claude CLI project-index records with a bounded
metadata prefix from current `sdk-cli` JSONL files. Claude Desktop's local
metadata supplies Desktop titles and archive state. Desktop metadata wins when
both sources refer to the same Claude Code session ID; CLI-only transcripts
remain visible because the CLI has no archive flag. Transcript reads use opaque
byte-offset cursors and bounded backward file reads, so selecting a large
session or loading an older page does not read the whole JSONL history into one
Gateway response.

Both node commands are read-only. They expose catalog metadata and transcript
content only through the generic `sessions.catalog.list` and
`sessions.catalog.read` methods to an authenticated operator connection with
`operator.write`. Paired-node rows stay view-only. A Gateway-local Claude CLI
row can be adopted from the normal Chat composer: OpenClaw imports bounded
visible history, resumes with `--fork-session` on the first turn, and leaves the
source transcript untouched. Claude Desktop rows remain view-only.

See [Anthropic: Claude sessions across computers](/providers/anthropic#claude-sessions-across-computers)
for the Control UI behavior and storage sources.

## Invoking commands

Low-level (raw RPC):

```bash
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command canvas.eval --params '{"javaScript":"location.href"}'
```

`nodes invoke` blocks `system.run` and `system.run.prepare`; those commands only run through the `exec` tool with `host=node` (see above). Higher-level helpers exist for the common "give the agent a MEDIA attachment" workflows (canvas, camera, screen, location, below).

## Command policy

Node commands must pass two gates before they can be invoked:

1. The node must declare the command in its authenticated connect metadata (`connect.commands`).
2. The gateway's platform-and-approval-derived allowlist must include the declared command.

Default allowlists by platform (before plugin defaults and `allowCommands`/`denyCommands` overrides):

| Platform | Commands allowed by default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

These rows describe the Gateway policy ceiling, not the commands implemented by every node app. A command is usable only when the connected node also declares it. In particular, the current macOS app does not declare the device and personal-data families listed in the macOS policy row.

`canvas.*` commands (`canvas.present`, `canvas.hide`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.*`) are a plugin default on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and unknown platforms (not Linux); all of them are foreground-restricted on iOS.

`talk.ptt.start`, `talk.ptt.stop`, `talk.ptt.cancel`, and `talk.ptt.once` are allowed by default for any node that advertises the `talk` capability or declares `talk.*` commands, independent of platform label.

Desktop host commands (`system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`, `browser.proxy`, `mcp.tools.call.v1`, and `screen.snapshot` on macOS/Windows) are not part of the static platform-default table above. They become available once the operator approves a pairing request that declares them, after which the node's approved command set carries them forward on reconnect.

Dangerous or privacy-heavy commands still require explicit opt-in with `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`, even if a node declares them: `camera.snap`, `camera.clip`, `screen.record`, `computer.act`, `contacts.add`, `calendar.add`, `reminders.add`, `sms.send`, `sms.search`. `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` always wins over defaults and extra allowlist entries. See [Computer use](/nodes/computer-use) for the additional macOS, tool-policy, and arming gates around desktop input.

Plugin-owned node commands can add a Gateway node-invoke policy. That policy runs after the allowlist check and before forwarding to the node, so raw `node.invoke`, CLI helpers, and dedicated agent tools share the same plugin permission boundary. Dangerous plugin node commands still require explicit `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` opt-in.

After a node changes its declared command list, reject the old device pairing and approve the new request so the gateway stores the updated command snapshot.

## Config (`openclaw.json`)

Node-related settings live under `gateway.nodes` and `tools.exec`:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    nodes: {
      // Auto-approve first-time node pairing from trusted networks (CIDR list).
      // Disabled when unset. Only applies to first-time role:node requests
      // with no requested scopes; does not auto-approve upgrades.
      pairing: {
        autoApproveCidrs: ["192.168.1.0/24"],
        // SSH-verified auto-approval (default: enabled). Approves first-time
        // node pairing on an exact device-key match read back over SSH.
        sshVerify: true,
      },
      // Trust agent-visible plugin tools published by paired nodes (default: true).
      pluginTools: {
        enabled: true,
      },
      // Opt into dangerous/privacy-heavy node commands (camera.snap, etc.).
      allowCommands: ["camera.snap", "screen.record"],
      // Block exact command names even if defaults or allowCommands include them.
      denyCommands: ["camera.clip"],
    },
  },
  tools: {
    exec: {
      // Default exec host: "node" routes all exec calls to a paired node.
      host: "node",
      // Security mode for node exec: allow only approved/allowlisted commands.
      security: "allowlist",
      // Pin exec to a specific node (id or name). Omit to allow any node.
      node: "build-node",
    },
  },
}
```

Use exact node command names. `denyCommands` removes a command even when a platform default or `allowCommands` entry would otherwise allow it. Paired nodes may publish agent-visible plugin tool descriptors by default, but each descriptor's command must still be in the node's approved command surface. Set `gateway.nodes.pluginTools.enabled: false` to ignore all such descriptors. See [Gateway configuration reference](/gateway/configuration-reference#gateway) for gateway node pairing and command-policy field details.

Per-agent exec node override:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        tools: { exec: { node: "build-node" } },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

## Screenshots (canvas snapshots)

If the node is showing the Canvas (WebView), `canvas.snapshot` returns `{ format, base64 }`.

CLI helper (writes to a temp file and prints the saved path):

```bash
openclaw nodes canvas snapshot --node <idOrNameOrIp> --format png
openclaw nodes canvas snapshot --node <idOrNameOrIp> --format jpg --max-width 1200 --quality 0.9
```

### Canvas controls

```bash
openclaw nodes canvas present --node <idOrNameOrIp> --target https://example.com
openclaw nodes canvas hide --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw nodes canvas navigate https://example.com --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw nodes canvas eval --node <idOrNameOrIp> --js "document.title"
```

Notes:

- `canvas present` accepts URLs or local file paths (`--target`), plus optional `--x/--y/--width/--height` for positioning.
- `canvas eval` accepts inline JS (`--js`) or a positional arg.

### A2UI (Canvas)

```bash
openclaw nodes canvas a2ui push --node <idOrNameOrIp> --text "Hello"
openclaw nodes canvas a2ui push --node <idOrNameOrIp> --jsonl ./payload.jsonl
openclaw nodes canvas a2ui reset --node <idOrNameOrIp>
```

Notes:

- Mobile nodes use a bundled app-owned A2UI page for action-capable rendering.
- Only A2UI v0.8 JSONL is supported (v0.9/createSurface is rejected).
- iOS and Android render remote Gateway Canvas pages, but A2UI button actions are dispatched only from the bundled app-owned A2UI page. Gateway-hosted HTTP/HTTPS A2UI pages are render-only on those mobile clients.

## Photos + videos (node camera)

Photos (`jpg`):

```bash
openclaw nodes camera list --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw nodes camera snap --node <idOrNameOrIp>            # default: both facings (2 MEDIA lines)
openclaw nodes camera snap --node <idOrNameOrIp> --facing front
openclaw nodes camera snap --node <idOrNameOrIp> --device-id <id> --max-width 1200 --quality 0.9 --delay-ms 2000
```

Video clips (`mp4`):

```bash
openclaw nodes camera clip --node <idOrNameOrIp> --duration 10s
openclaw nodes camera clip --node <idOrNameOrIp> --duration 3000 --no-audio
```

Notes:

- The node must be **foregrounded** for `canvas.*` and `camera.*` (background calls return `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE`).
- Nodes clamp clip duration to keep the base64 payload manageable (see [Camera capture](/nodes/camera) for exact per-platform limits). The `nodes` agent tool additionally caps requested `durationMs` at 300000 (5 minutes) before forwarding the call; the node itself enforces the tighter limit.
- Android will prompt for `CAMERA`/`RECORD_AUDIO` permissions when possible; denied permissions fail with `*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`.

## Screen recordings (nodes)

Supported nodes expose `screen.record` (mp4). Example:

```bash
openclaw nodes screen record --node <idOrNameOrIp> --duration 10s --fps 10
openclaw nodes screen record --node <idOrNameOrIp> --duration 10s --fps 10 --no-audio
```

Notes:

- `screen.record` availability depends on node platform.
- The `nodes` agent tool caps requested `durationMs` at 300000 (5 minutes); the node may enforce a tighter limit to bound the returned payload.
- `--no-audio` disables microphone capture on supported platforms.
- Use `--screen <index>` to select a display when multiple screens are available (0 = primary).

## Location (nodes)

Nodes expose `location.get` when Location is enabled in settings.

CLI helper:

```bash
openclaw nodes location get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
openclaw nodes location get --node <idOrNameOrIp> --accuracy precise --max-age 15000 --location-timeout 10000
```

Notes:

- Location is **off by default**.
- "Always" requires system permission; background fetch is best-effort.
- The response includes lat/lon, accuracy (meters), and timestamp.
- Full parameter/response shape and error codes: [Location command](/nodes/location-command).

## SMS (Android nodes)

Android nodes can expose `sms.send` and `sms.search` when the user grants **SMS** permission and the device supports telephony. Both commands are dangerous-by-default: the gateway operator must also add them to `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` before they can be invoked (see [Command policy](#command-policy)).

For read-only SMS search, opt in explicitly in `openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    nodes: {
      allowCommands: ["sms.search"],
    },
  },
}
```

Add `sms.send` separately only when the node should also be able to send messages. Android permission and Gateway command authorization are independent; granting the phone permission does not edit Gateway policy.

Low-level invoke:

```bash
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command sms.send --params '{"to":"+15555550123","message":"Hello from OpenClaw"}'
```

Notes:

- `sms.search` may be declared before `READ_SMS` is granted so an invocation can return a permission diagnostic; reading messages still requires that Android permission.
- Wi-Fi-only devices without telephony will not advertise `sms.send`.
- A `requires explicit gateway.nodes.allowCommands opt-in` error means the phone declared the command but the Gateway operator has not authorized it.

## Device and personal data commands

iOS and Android nodes advertise several read-only data commands by default (see the [Command policy](#command-policy) table); Android additionally exposes a larger family gated by its own in-app settings.

Available families:

- `device.status`, `device.info` — iOS, Android, Windows.
- `device.permissions`, `device.health`, `device.apps` — Android only; `device.apps` requires Installed Apps sharing enabled in Android Settings and returns launcher-visible apps by default.
- `notifications.list`, `notifications.actions` — Android only.
- `photos.latest` — iOS, Android.
- `contacts.search` — iOS, Android (read-only default); `contacts.add` is dangerous and needs `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`.
- `calendar.events` — iOS, Android (read-only default); `calendar.add` is dangerous and needs `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`.
- `reminders.list` — iOS, Android (read-only default); `reminders.add` is dangerous and needs `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`.
- `callLog.search` — Android only.
- `motion.activity`, `motion.pedometer` — iOS, Android; capability-gated by available sensors.

Example invokes:

```bash
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command device.status --params '{}'
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command device.apps --params '{"limit":10}'
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command notifications.list --params '{}'
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command photos.latest --params '{"limit":1}'
```

## System commands (node host / mac node)

The macOS node exposes `system.run`, `system.which`, `system.notify`, and `system.execApprovals.get/set`. The headless node host exposes `system.run.prepare`, `system.run`, `system.which`, and `system.execApprovals.get/set`.

Examples:

```bash
openclaw nodes notify --node <idOrNameOrIp> --title "Ping" --body "Gateway ready"
openclaw nodes invoke --node <idOrNameOrIp> --command system.which --params '{"bins":["git"]}'
```

Notes:

- `system.run` returns stdout/stderr/exit code in the payload.
- Shell execution now goes through the `exec` tool with `host=node`; `nodes` remains the direct-RPC surface for explicit node commands.
- `nodes invoke` does not expose `system.run` or `system.run.prepare`; those stay on the exec path only.
- The exec path prepares a canonical `systemRunPlan` before approval. Once an approval is granted, the gateway forwards that stored plan, not any later caller-edited command/cwd/session fields.
- `system.notify` respects notification permission state on the macOS app; supports `--priority <passive|active|timeSensitive>` and `--delivery <system|overlay|auto>`.
- Unrecognized node `platform` / `deviceFamily` metadata uses a conservative default allowlist that excludes `system.run` and `system.which`. If you intentionally need those commands for an unknown platform, add them explicitly via `gateway.nodes.allowCommands`.
- `system.run` supports `--cwd`, `--env KEY=VAL`, `--command-timeout`, and `--needs-screen-recording`.
- For shell wrappers (`bash|sh|zsh ... -c/-lc`), request-scoped `--env` values are reduced to an explicit allowlist (`TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_*`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`).
- For allow-always decisions in allowlist mode, known dispatch wrappers (`env`, `flock`, `nice`, `nohup`, `stdbuf`, `timeout`) persist inner executable paths instead of wrapper paths. If unwrapping is not safe, no allowlist entry is persisted automatically.
- On Windows node hosts in allowlist mode, shell-wrapper runs via `cmd.exe /c` require approval (allowlist entry alone does not auto-allow the wrapper form).
- Node hosts ignore `PATH` overrides in `--env` and strip a large, maintained set of interpreter/shell startup variables (for example `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PYTHONPATH`, `BASH_ENV`, `DYLD_*`, `LD_*`) before running a command. If you need extra PATH entries, configure the node host service environment (or install tools in standard locations) instead of passing `PATH` via `--env`.
- On macOS node mode, `system.run` is gated by exec approvals in the macOS app (Settings → Exec approvals). Ask/allowlist/full behave the same as the headless node host; denied prompts return `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED`.
- On headless node host, `system.run` is gated by exec approvals (`~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`); on macOS specifically, see the exec-host routing env vars under [Headless node host](#headless-node-host-cross-platform) below.

## Exec node binding

When multiple nodes are available, you can bind exec to a specific node. This sets the default node for `exec host=node` (and can be overridden per agent).

Global default:

```bash
openclaw config set tools.exec.node "node-id-or-name"
```

Per-agent override:

```bash
openclaw config get agents.list
openclaw config set 'agents.list[0].tools.exec.node' "node-id-or-name"
```

Unset to allow any node:

```bash
openclaw config unset tools.exec.node
openclaw config unset 'agents.list[0].tools.exec.node'
```

## Permissions map

Nodes may include a `permissions` map in `node.list` / `node.describe`, keyed by permission name (e.g. `screenRecording`, `accessibility`, `location`) with boolean values (`true` = granted).

## Headless node host (cross-platform)

OpenClaw can run a **headless node host** (no UI) that connects to the Gateway WebSocket and exposes `system.run` / `system.which`. This is useful on Linux/Windows or for running a minimal node alongside a server.

Start it:

```bash
openclaw node run --host <gateway-host> --port 18789
```

Notes:

- Pairing is still required (the Gateway will show a device pairing prompt).
- Client instance metadata, signed device identity, and pairing auth use separate files; see [Headless identity state](#headless-identity-state).
- Exec approvals are enforced locally via `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json` (see [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals)).
- On macOS, the headless node host executes `system.run` locally by default. Set `OPENCLAW_NODE_EXEC_HOST=app` to route `system.run` through the companion app exec host; add `OPENCLAW_NODE_EXEC_FALLBACK=0` to require the app host and fail closed if it is unavailable.
- Add `--tls` / `--tls-fingerprint` when the Gateway WS uses TLS.

## Mac node mode

- The macOS menubar app connects to the Gateway WS server as a node (so `openclaw nodes …` works against this Mac).
- In remote mode, the app opens an SSH tunnel for the Gateway port and connects to `localhost`.
