# GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is GitHub's AI coding assistant. It provides access to Copilot
models for your GitHub account and plan. OpenClaw can use Copilot as a model
provider in two different ways.

## Two ways to use Copilot in OpenClaw

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Built-in provider (github-copilot)">
    Use the native device-login flow to obtain a GitHub token, then exchange it for
    Copilot API tokens when OpenClaw runs. This is the **default** and simplest path
    because it does not require VS Code.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run the login command">
        ```bash
        openclaw models auth login-github-copilot
        ```

        You will be prompted to visit a URL and enter a one-time code. Keep the
        terminal open until it completes.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set a default model">
        ```bash
        openclaw models set github-copilot/gpt-4o
        ```

        Or in config:

        ```json5
        {
          agents: { defaults: { model: { primary: "github-copilot/gpt-4o" } } },
        }
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Copilot Proxy plugin (copilot-proxy)">
    Use the **Copilot Proxy** VS Code extension as a local bridge. OpenClaw talks to
    the proxy's `/v1` endpoint and uses the model list you configure there.

    <Note>
    Choose this when you already run Copilot Proxy in VS Code or need to route
    through it. You must enable the plugin and keep the VS Code extension running.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Optional flags

| Flag            | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--yes`         | Skip the confirmation prompt                        |
| `--set-default` | Also apply the provider's recommended default model |

```bash
# Skip confirmation
openclaw models auth login-github-copilot --yes

# Login and set the default model in one step
openclaw models auth login --provider github-copilot --method device --set-default
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Interactive TTY required">
    The device-login flow requires an interactive TTY. Run it directly in a
    terminal, not in a non-interactive script or CI pipeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model availability depends on your plan">
    Copilot model availability depends on your GitHub plan. If a model is
    rejected, try another ID (for example `github-copilot/gpt-4.1`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transport selection">
    Claude model IDs use the Anthropic Messages transport automatically. GPT,
    o-series, and Gemini models keep the OpenAI Responses transport. OpenClaw
    selects the correct transport based on the model ref.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token storage">
    The login stores a GitHub token in the auth profile store and exchanges it
    for a Copilot API token when OpenClaw runs. You do not need to manage the
    token manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Requires an interactive TTY. Run the login command directly in a terminal, not
inside a headless script or CI job.
</Warning>
