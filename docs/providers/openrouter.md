OpenRouter routes requests to many models behind one API and one key. It is
OpenAI-compatible, so OpenClaw talks to it over the same
`openai-completions`-style transport used for other proxy providers.

## Getting started

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run OAuth onboarding">
        ```bash
        openclaw onboard --auth-choice openrouter-oauth
        ```

        OpenClaw opens OpenRouter's browser sign-in flow (PKCE), exchanges the
        code for an OpenRouter API key, and stores it in the default
        OpenRouter auth profile. On remote/headless hosts, OpenClaw prints the
        sign-in URL and asks you to paste the redirect URL after signing in.

      <Step title="(Optional) Switch to a specific model">
        Onboarding defaults to `openrouter/auto`. Pick a concrete model later:

        ```bash
        openclaw models set openrouter/<provider>/<model>
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Run API-key onboarding">

      <Step title="(Optional) Switch to a specific model">
        Onboarding defaults to `openrouter/auto`. Pick a concrete model later:

## Config example

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "openrouter/auto" },
    },
  },
}
```

## Model references

<Note>
Model refs follow the pattern `openrouter/<provider>/<model>`. For the full list of
available providers and models, see [/concepts/model-providers](/concepts/model-providers).
</Note>

Bundled fallback models, used when live catalog discovery is unavailable:

| Model ref                         | Notes                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `openrouter/auto`                 | OpenRouter automatic routing |
| `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` | Kimi K2.6 via MoonshotAI     |
| `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` | Kimi K2.5 via MoonshotAI     |

Any other `openrouter/<provider>/<model>` ref, including
`openrouter/openrouter/fusion` (see [Fusion router](#fusion-router)), resolves
dynamically against OpenRouter's live model catalog.

## Image generation

OpenRouter can back the `image_generate` tool. Set an OpenRouter image model
under `agents.defaults.imageGenerationModel`:

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      imageGenerationModel: {
        primary: "openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview",
        timeoutMs: 180_000,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

OpenClaw sends image requests to OpenRouter's chat-completions image API with
`modalities: ["image", "text"]`. Gemini image models additionally receive
`aspectRatio` and `resolution` hints through OpenRouter's `image_config`; other
image models do not. Use `agents.defaults.imageGenerationModel.timeoutMs` for
slower models; the `image_generate` tool's per-call `timeoutMs` still wins.

## Video generation

OpenRouter can back the `video_generate` tool through its asynchronous
`/videos` API. Set an OpenRouter video model under
`agents.defaults.videoGenerationModel`:

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      videoGenerationModel: {
        primary: "openrouter/google/veo-3.1-fast",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

OpenClaw submits text-to-video and image-to-video jobs, polls the returned
`polling_url`, and downloads the finished video from OpenRouter's
`unsigned_urls` or the job content endpoint. Reference images default to
first/last-frame images; images tagged `reference_image` are sent as input
references instead. The bundled `google/veo-3.1-fast` default supports 4/6/8
second durations, `720P`/`1080P` resolutions, and `16:9`/`9:16` aspect ratios.
Video-to-video is not supported: the upstream API only accepts text and image
references.

## Music generation

OpenRouter can back the `music_generate` tool through chat-completions audio
output. Set an OpenRouter audio model under
`agents.defaults.musicGenerationModel`:

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      musicGenerationModel: {
        primary: "openrouter/google/lyria-3-pro-preview",
        timeoutMs: 180_000,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The bundled OpenRouter music provider defaults to `google/lyria-3-pro-preview`
and also exposes `google/lyria-3-clip-preview`. OpenClaw sends `modalities:
["text", "audio"]`, streams the response, collects the audio chunks, and saves
the result as generated media for channel delivery. Lyria models accept one
reference image through the shared `music_generate image=...` parameter.

## Text-to-speech

OpenRouter can act as a TTS provider through its OpenAI-compatible
`/audio/speech` endpoint.

```json5
{
  messages: {
    tts: {
      auto: "always",
      provider: "openrouter",
      providers: {
        openrouter: {
          model: "hexgrad/kokoro-82m",
          speakerVoice: "af_alloy",
          responseFormat: "mp3",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

If `messages.tts.providers.openrouter.apiKey` is omitted, TTS falls back to
`models.providers.openrouter.apiKey`, then `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Speech-to-text (inbound audio)

OpenRouter can transcribe inbound voice/audio attachments through the shared
`tools.media.audio` path, using its STT endpoint (`/audio/transcriptions`).
This applies to any channel plugin that forwards inbound voice/audio into
media understanding preflight.

```json5
{
  tools: {
    media: {
      audio: {
        enabled: true,
        models: [{ provider: "openrouter", model: "openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo" }],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

OpenClaw sends OpenRouter STT requests as JSON with base64 audio under
`input_audio` (OpenRouter's STT contract), not as multipart OpenAI form
uploads.

## Fusion router

OpenRouter Fusion sends one OpenClaw model ref to several OpenRouter models in
parallel, has OpenRouter judge their answers, and returns one final response
through the normal OpenRouter endpoint. The upstream model slug is
`openrouter/fusion`, so the OpenClaw model ref carries both the OpenClaw
provider prefix and the upstream OpenRouter namespace:

```bash
openclaw models set openrouter/openrouter/fusion
```

Configure Fusion's panel and judge through the model's `params.extraBody`;
those fields forward directly into the OpenRouter chat-completions request
body. Fusion works with either OAuth or API-key onboarding; if you use OAuth,
omit the `env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY` line below.

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "openrouter/openrouter/fusion" },
      models: {
        "openrouter/openrouter/fusion": {
          params: {
            extraBody: {
              plugins: [
                {
                  id: "fusion",
                  analysis_models: [
                    "google/gemini-3.5-flash",
                    "moonshotai/kimi-k2.6",
                    "deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro",
                  ],
                  model: "google/gemini-3.5-flash",
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`analysis_models` is the parallel panel; `model` inside the Fusion plugin
config is the judge model. Do not set top-level `tool_choice` to `"required"`
in normal agent/chat turns to try to force Fusion: OpenClaw turns can include
its own tool definitions, and a top-level required tool choice may pick one of
those instead of the Fusion router. When this Fusion plugin config is present,
OpenClaw adds a sanitized system-prompt note listing the configured analysis
models and judge model, so the agent can answer questions about its own Fusion
panel. Other `extraBody` fields are not copied into the prompt.

Fusion is slower by design: OpenRouter fans the prompt out to multiple
analysis models, then runs a judge/synthesis step, so latency runs higher than
a direct single-model request. Use it for deliberate, high-quality answers or
escalation paths, not as a latency-sensitive default. Keep the panel small and
pick faster analysis/judge models for quicker responses.

Test a configured ref with a one-shot local call:

```bash
openclaw infer model run --local \
  --model openrouter/openrouter/fusion \
  --prompt "Reply with exactly: FUSION_OK" \
  --json
```

## Authentication and headers

OpenRouter uses a Bearer token from your API key. OpenRouter OAuth is a PKCE
login flow that issues an OpenRouter API key, so OpenClaw stores the result in
the same `openrouter:default` API-key auth profile used by manual API-key
setup.

To sign in or rotate the stored key on an existing install without rerunning
full onboarding:

```bash
openclaw models auth login --provider openrouter --method oauth
openclaw models auth login --provider openrouter --method api-key
```

On verified OpenRouter requests (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`), OpenClaw adds
OpenRouter's documented app-attribution headers:

| Header                    | Value                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HTTP-Referer`            | `https://openclaw.ai`                                                                                  |
| `X-OpenRouter-Title`      | `OpenClaw`                                                                                             |
| `X-OpenRouter-Categories` | `cli-agent,cloud-agent,programming-app,creative-writing,writing-assistant,general-chat,personal-agent` |

<Warning>
If you repoint the OpenRouter provider at some other proxy or base URL, OpenClaw
does **not** inject those OpenRouter-specific headers or Anthropic cache markers.
</Warning>

## Advanced configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response caching">
    OpenRouter response caching is opt-in. Enable it per model:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          models: {
            "openrouter/auto": {
              params: {
                responseCache: true,
                responseCacheTtlSeconds: 300,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    OpenClaw sends `X-OpenRouter-Cache: true` and, when configured,
    `X-OpenRouter-Cache-TTL`. `responseCacheClear: true` forces a refresh for
    the current request and stores the replacement response. Snake_case
    aliases (`response_cache`, `response_cache_ttl_seconds`,
    `response_cache_clear`) are accepted, as is `responseCacheTtl` /
    `response_cache_ttl` without the `Seconds` suffix.

    This is separate from provider prompt caching and from OpenRouter's
    Anthropic `cache_control` markers. It only applies on verified
    `openrouter.ai` routes, not custom proxy base URLs.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Anthropic cache markers">
    On verified OpenRouter routes, Anthropic model refs keep OpenRouter's
    Anthropic `cache_control` markers for better prompt-cache reuse on
    system/developer prompt blocks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Anthropic reasoning prefill">
    On verified OpenRouter routes, Anthropic model refs with reasoning enabled
    drop trailing assistant prefill turns before the request reaches
    OpenRouter, matching Anthropic's requirement that reasoning conversations
    end with a user turn.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thinking / reasoning injection">
    On supported non-`auto` routes, OpenClaw maps the selected thinking level
    to OpenRouter proxy reasoning payloads. `openrouter/auto` and unsupported
    model hints skip that injection. Stale `openrouter/hunter-alpha` refs also
    skip it, because OpenRouter could return final answer text in reasoning
    fields on that retired route.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DeepSeek V4 reasoning replay">
    On verified OpenRouter routes, `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` and
    `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` fill missing `reasoning_content` on
    replayed assistant turns, keeping thinking/tool conversations in DeepSeek
    V4's required follow-up shape. OpenClaw sends OpenRouter-supported
    `reasoning.effort` values for these routes: `xhigh`/`max` map to `xhigh`,
    every other non-off level maps to `high`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAI-only request shaping">
    OpenRouter runs through the proxy-style OpenAI-compatible path, so native
    OpenAI-only request shaping such as `serviceTier`, Responses `store`,
    OpenAI reasoning-compat payloads, and prompt-cache hints is not forwarded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gemini-backed routes">
    Gemini-backed OpenRouter refs stay on the proxy-Gemini path: OpenClaw keeps
    Gemini thought-signature sanitation there, but does not enable native
    Gemini replay validation or bootstrap rewrites.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider routing metadata">
    OpenRouter supports a `provider` request object for underlying provider
    routing. Configure a default policy for all OpenRouter text-model requests
    with `models.providers.openrouter.params.provider`:

    ```json5
    {
      models: {
        providers: {
          openrouter: {
            params: {
              provider: {
                sort: "latency",
                require_parameters: true,
                data_collection: "deny",
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    OpenClaw forwards that object to OpenRouter as the request `provider`
    payload. Use OpenRouter's documented snake_case fields, including `sort`,
    `only`, `ignore`, `order`, `allow_fallbacks`, `require_parameters`,
    `data_collection`, `quantizations`, `max_price`, `preferred_max_latency`,
    `preferred_min_throughput`, `zdr`, and `enforce_distillable_text`.

    Per-model params override the provider-wide routing object:

    ```json5
    {
      agents: {
        defaults: {
          models: {
            "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6": {
              params: {
                provider: {
                  order: ["anthropic"],
                  allow_fallbacks: false,
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    This only applies on OpenRouter chat-completions routes. Direct Anthropic,
    Google, OpenAI, or custom provider routes ignore OpenRouter routing params.
