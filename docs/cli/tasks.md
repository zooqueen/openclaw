# `openclaw tasks`

Inspect durable background tasks and Task Flow state. With no subcommand,
`openclaw tasks` is equivalent to `openclaw tasks list`.

See [Background Tasks](/automation/tasks) for the lifecycle and delivery model.

## Usage

```bash
openclaw tasks
openclaw tasks list
openclaw tasks list --runtime acp
openclaw tasks list --status running
openclaw tasks show <lookup>
openclaw tasks notify <lookup> state_changes
openclaw tasks cancel <lookup>
openclaw tasks audit
openclaw tasks maintenance
openclaw tasks maintenance --apply
openclaw tasks flow list
openclaw tasks flow show <lookup>
openclaw tasks flow cancel <lookup>
```

## Root Options

- `--json`: output JSON.
- `--runtime <name>`: filter by kind: `subagent`, `acp`, `cron`, or `cli`.
- `--status <name>`: filter by status: `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, or `lost`.

## Subcommands

### `list`

```bash
openclaw tasks list [--runtime <name>] [--status <name>] [--json]
```

Lists tracked background tasks newest first.

### `show`

```bash
openclaw tasks show <lookup> [--json]

### `notify`

openclaw tasks notify <lookup> <done_only|state_changes|silent>
```

### `cancel`

```bash
openclaw tasks cancel <lookup>

Cancels a running background task.

### `audit`

```bash
openclaw tasks audit [--severity <warn|error>] [--code <name>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

Surfaces stale, lost, delivery-failed, or otherwise inconsistent task and Task Flow records.

### `maintenance`

```bash
openclaw tasks maintenance [--apply] [--json]
```

Previews or applies task and Task Flow reconciliation, cleanup stamping, and pruning.

### `flow`
