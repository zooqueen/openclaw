## Postures

| Posture | Command                  | Behavior                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inspect | `openclaw doctor`        | Human-oriented checks and guided prompts.                                   |
| Repair  | `openclaw doctor --fix`  | Applies supported repairs, prompting unless non-interactive repair is safe. |
| Lint    | `openclaw doctor --lint` | Read-only structured findings for CI, preflight, and review gates.          |

Prefer `--lint` when automation needs a stable result. Prefer `--fix` when a human operator wants doctor to edit config or state.

## Examples

```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw doctor --lint
openclaw doctor --lint --json
openclaw doctor --lint --severity-min warning
openclaw doctor --lint --all
openclaw doctor --lint --allow-exec
openclaw doctor --deep
openclaw doctor --fix
openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
openclaw doctor --post-upgrade
openclaw doctor --post-upgrade --json
```

For channel-specific permissions, use the channel probes instead of `doctor`:

```bash
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:<channel-id>
openclaw channels status --probe
```

`channels capabilities` reports the bot's effective permissions for a specific channel target. `channels status --probe` audits all configured channels and voice auto-join targets.

## Options

| Option                       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-workspace-suggestions` | Disable workspace memory/search suggestions.                                                                                                                                            |
| `--yes`                      | Accept defaults without prompting.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--repair` / `--fix`         | Apply recommended non-service repairs without prompting (`--fix` is an alias). Gateway service installs/rewrites still require interactive confirmation or explicit `gateway` commands. |
| `--force`                    | Apply aggressive repairs, including overwriting custom service config.                                                                                                                  |
| `--non-interactive`          | Run without prompts; safe migrations and non-service repairs only.                                                                                                                      |
| `--generate-gateway-token`   | Generate and configure a gateway token.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--allow-exec`               | Allow doctor to execute configured `exec` SecretRefs while verifying secrets.                                                                                                           |
| `--deep`                     | Scan system services for extra gateway installs; report recent Gateway supervisor restart handoffs.                                                                                     |
| `--lint`                     | Run modernized health checks in read-only mode and emit diagnostic findings.                                                                                                            |
| `--post-upgrade`             | Run post-upgrade plugin compatibility probes; findings go to stdout; exit code 1 if any error-level finding is present.                                                                 |
| `--json`                     | With `--lint`: JSON findings. With `--post-upgrade`: machine-readable envelope `{ probesRun, findings }`.                                                                               |
| `--severity-min <level>`     | With `--lint`: drop findings below `info`, `warning`, or `error`.                                                                                                                       |
| `--all`                      | With `--lint`: run all registered checks, including opt-in checks excluded from the default set.                                                                                        |
| `--skip <id>`                | With `--lint`: skip a check id. Repeatable.                                                                                                                                             |
| `--only <id>`                | With `--lint`: run only the given check id(s). Repeatable.                                                                                                                              |

`--json`, `--severity-min`, `--all`, `--only`, and `--skip` are only accepted together with `--lint`.

## Lint mode

`openclaw doctor --lint` is read-only: no prompts, no repair, no config/state rewrites.

```bash
openclaw doctor --lint
openclaw doctor --lint --severity-min warning
openclaw doctor --lint --json
openclaw doctor --lint --all
openclaw doctor --lint --allow-exec
openclaw doctor --lint --only core/doctor/gateway-config --json
```

Human output is compact:

```text
doctor --lint: ran 6 check(s), 1 finding(s)
  [warning] core/doctor/gateway-config gateway.mode - gateway.mode is unset; gateway start will be blocked.
    fix: Run `openclaw configure` and set Gateway mode (local/remote), or `openclaw config set gateway.mode local`.
```

JSON output is the scripting surface:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "checksRun": 5,
  "checksSkipped": 0,
  "findings": [
    {
      "checkId": "core/doctor/gateway-config",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "gateway.mode is unset; gateway start will be blocked.",
      "path": "gateway.mode",
      "fixHint": "Run `openclaw configure` and set Gateway mode (local/remote), or `openclaw config set gateway.mode local`."
    }
  ]
}
```

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | No findings at or above the selected severity threshold.      |
| `1`  | At least one finding meets the selected threshold.            |
| `2`  | Command/runtime failure before lint findings can be produced. |

`--severity-min` controls both which findings print and the exit threshold: `openclaw doctor --lint --severity-min error` can print nothing and exit `0` even when lower-severity `info`/`warning` findings exist.

`--all` controls which checks are selected before severity filtering. The default lint run excludes checks that are deep, historical, or more likely to surface repairable legacy residue; use `--all` for the complete inventory. `--only <id>` is the most precise selector and can run any registered check by id.

## Structured health checks

Modern doctor checks use a small split contract:

```ts
detect(ctx, scope?) -> HealthFinding[]
repair?(ctx, findings) -> HealthRepairResult
```

`detect()` powers `doctor --lint`. `repair()` is optional and only runs under `doctor --fix` / `doctor --repair`. Checks that have not migrated to this shape still use the legacy doctor contribution flow.

Repair contexts can carry `dryRun`/`diff` requests; repair results can return structured `diffs` (config/file edits) and `effects` (service, process, package, state, or other side effects), so converted checks can grow toward `doctor --fix --dry-run` without moving mutation planning into `detect()`.

`repair()` reports `status: "repaired" | "skipped" | "failed"` (omitted status means `repaired`). When repair returns `skipped` or `failed`, doctor reports the reason and skips validation for that check. After a successful repair, doctor re-runs `detect()` scoped to the repaired findings; if the finding is still present, doctor reports a repair warning instead of treating the change as complete.

A finding includes:

| Field             | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `checkId`         | Stable id for skip/only filters and CI allowlists.     |
| `severity`        | `info`, `warning`, or `error`.                         |
| `message`         | Human-readable problem statement.                      |
| `path`            | Config, file, or logical path when available.          |
| `line` / `column` | Source location when available.                        |
| `ocPath`          | Precise `oc://` address when a check can point to one. |
| `fixHint`         | Suggested operator action or repair summary.           |

Modernized core doctor checks stay attached to the ordered doctor contribution that owns their human `doctor` / `doctor --fix` behavior. The shared structured health registry is the extension point: bundled and plugin-backed checks run after core doctor checks once their owning package registers them in the active command path. `openclaw/plugin-sdk/health` exposes the same contract for plugin authors.

## Check selection

```bash
openclaw doctor --lint --only core/doctor/gateway-config --json
openclaw doctor --lint --skip core/doctor/skills-readiness
openclaw doctor --lint --all --skip core/doctor/session-locks
```

`--only` and `--skip` accept full check ids and may be repeated. If an `--only` id is not registered, no check runs for that id; use `checksRun`/`checksSkipped` in the output to confirm a focused gate selects the checks you expect.

## Post-upgrade mode

`openclaw doctor --post-upgrade` runs plugin compatibility probes for chaining after a build or upgrade. Findings go to stdout; exit code is 1 if any finding has `level: "error"`. Add `--json` for a machine-readable envelope (`{ probesRun, findings }`), suitable for CI, the community `fork-upgrade` skill, and other post-upgrade smoke tooling. If the installed plugin index is missing or malformed, JSON mode still emits the envelope with a `plugin.index_unavailable` error finding.

Container image startup is the exception to the usual "run doctor after
updating" flow. When `openclaw gateway run` starts on a new OpenClaw version, it
runs safe state and plugin repairs before reporting ready. If repair cannot
finish safely, startup exits and tells you to run the same image once with
`openclaw doctor --fix` against the same mounted state/config before restarting
the container normally.

## Notes

- In Nix mode (`OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`), read-only doctor checks still work, but `doctor --fix`, `doctor --repair`, `doctor --yes`, and `doctor --generate-gateway-token` are disabled because `openclaw.json` is immutable. Edit the Nix source for this install instead; for nix-openclaw, use the agent-first [Quick Start](https://github.com/openclaw/nix-openclaw#quick-start).
- Interactive prompts (keychain/OAuth fixes, etc.) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) skip prompts.
- Non-interactive `doctor` runs skip eager plugin loading so headless health checks stay fast. Interactive sessions still load the plugin surfaces needed by the legacy health/repair flow.
- `--lint` is stricter than `--non-interactive`: always read-only, never prompts, never applies safe migrations. Use `doctor --fix` or `doctor --repair` when you want doctor to make changes.
- Doctor does not execute `exec` SecretRefs while checking secrets by default. Use `--allow-exec` (with or without `--lint`) only when you intentionally want doctor to run those configured secret resolvers.
- Any config write (including a `--fix` repair) rotates a backup to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak` (with a numbered `.bak.1`..`.bak.4` ring). `--fix` also drops unknown config keys reported by schema validation, listing each removal; it skips this while an update is in progress so partially written upgrade state is not stripped before its migration finishes.
- Set `OPENCLAW_SERVICE_REPAIR_POLICY=external` when another supervisor owns the gateway lifecycle. Doctor still reports gateway/service health and applies non-service repairs, but skips service install/start/restart/bootstrap and legacy service cleanup.
- On Linux, doctor ignores inactive extra gateway-like systemd units and does not rewrite command/entrypoint metadata for a running systemd gateway service during repair. Stop the service first, or use `openclaw gateway install --force` to replace the active launcher.
- `doctor --fix --non-interactive` reports missing or stale gateway service definitions but does not install or rewrite them outside update repair mode. Run `openclaw gateway install` for a missing service, or `openclaw gateway install --force` to replace the launcher.
- State integrity checks detect orphan transcript files in the sessions directory. Archiving them as `.deleted.<timestamp>` requires interactive confirmation; `--fix`, `--yes`, and headless runs leave them in place.
- Doctor scans `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` (or `cron.store`) for legacy cron job shapes and rewrites them before importing canonical rows into SQLite.
- Doctor reports cron jobs with an explicit `payload.model` override, including provider-namespace counts and mismatches against `agents.defaults.model`, so scheduled jobs that do not inherit the default model are visible during auth or billing investigations.
- On Linux, doctor warns when the user's crontab still runs the unmaintained legacy `~/.openclaw/bin/ensure-whatsapp.sh`, which can misreport `Gateway inactive` when cron lacks the systemd user-bus environment.
- When WhatsApp is enabled, doctor checks for a degraded Gateway event loop with local `openclaw-tui` clients still running. `doctor --fix` stops only verified local TUI clients so WhatsApp replies are not queued behind stale TUI refresh loops.
- Doctor rewrites legacy `openai-codex/*` model refs to canonical `openai/*` refs across primary models, fallbacks, image/video generation models, heartbeat/subagent/compaction overrides, hooks, channel model overrides, and stale session route pins. `--fix` also migrates legacy `openai-codex:*` auth profiles and `auth.order.openai-codex` entries to `openai:*`, moves Codex intent onto provider/model-scoped `agentRuntime.id: "codex"` entries, removes stale whole-agent/session runtime pins, and keeps repaired OpenAI agent refs on Codex auth routing instead of direct OpenAI API-key auth.
- Doctor cleans legacy plugin dependency staging state from older OpenClaw versions and relinks the host `openclaw` package for managed npm plugins that declare it as a peer dependency. It also repairs missing downloadable plugins referenced by config (`plugins.entries`, configured channels, configured provider/search settings, configured agent runtimes). During package updates, doctor skips package-manager plugin repair until the package swap completes; rerun `openclaw doctor --fix` afterward if a configured plugin still needs recovery. If a download fails, doctor reports the install error and preserves the configured plugin entry for the next repair attempt.
- Doctor repairs stale plugin config by removing missing plugin ids from `plugins.allow`/`plugins.deny`/`plugins.entries`, plus matching dangling channel config, heartbeat targets, and channel model overrides, when plugin discovery is healthy.
- Doctor quarantines invalid plugin config by disabling the affected `plugins.entries.<id>` entry and removing its invalid `config` payload. Gateway startup already skips only that bad plugin so other plugins and channels keep running.
- Doctor removes the retired `plugins.entries.codex.config.codexDynamicToolsProfile`; the Codex app-server always keeps Codex-native workspace tools native.
- Doctor auto-migrates legacy flat Talk config (`talk.voiceId`, `talk.modelId`, and friends) into `talk.provider` + `talk.providers.<provider>`. Repeat `doctor --fix` runs no longer report/apply Talk normalization when the only difference is object key order.
- Doctor includes a memory-search readiness check and can recommend `openclaw configure --section model` when embedding credentials are missing.
- Doctor warns when no command owner is configured. The command owner is the human operator account allowed to run owner-only commands and approve dangerous actions. DM pairing only lets someone talk to the bot; if you approved a sender before first-owner bootstrap existed, set `commands.ownerAllowFrom` explicitly.
- Doctor reports an info note when Codex-mode agents are configured and personal Codex CLI assets exist in the operator's Codex home. Local Codex app-server launches use isolated per-agent homes; install the Codex plugin first if needed, then use `openclaw migrate plan codex` to inventory assets that should be promoted deliberately.
- Doctor warns when skills allowed for the default agent are unavailable in the current runtime environment (missing bins, env vars, config, or OS requirements). `doctor --fix` can disable those unavailable skills with `skills.entries.<skill>.enabled=false`; install/configure the missing requirement instead if you want to keep the skill active.
- If sandbox mode is enabled but Docker is unavailable, doctor reports a high-signal warning with remediation (`install Docker` or `openclaw config set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode off`).
- If legacy sandbox registry files or shard directories are present (`~/.openclaw/sandbox/containers.json`, `~/.openclaw/sandbox/browsers.json`, `~/.openclaw/sandbox/containers/`, or `~/.openclaw/sandbox/browsers/`), doctor reports them; `--fix` migrates valid entries into SQLite and quarantines invalid legacy files.
- If `gateway.auth.token`/`gateway.auth.password` are SecretRef-managed and unavailable in the current command path, doctor reports a read-only warning and does not write plaintext fallback credentials. For exec-backed SecretRefs, doctor skips execution unless `--allow-exec` is present.
- If channel SecretRef inspection fails in a fix path, doctor continues and reports a warning instead of exiting early.
- After state-directory migrations, doctor warns when enabled default Telegram or Discord accounts depend on env fallback and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is unavailable to the doctor process.
- Telegram `allowFrom` username auto-resolution (`doctor --fix`) requires a resolvable Telegram token in the current command path. If token inspection is unavailable, doctor reports a warning and skips auto-resolution for that pass.

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent "unauthorized" errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
