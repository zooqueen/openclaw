## Commands

### `openclaw skills list`

List all skills with status, capabilities, and source.

```bash
openclaw skills list              # all skills
openclaw skills list --eligible   # only ready-to-use skills
openclaw skills list --json       # JSON output
openclaw skills list -v           # verbose (show missing requirements)
```

Output columns: **Status** (`+ ready`, `x missing`, `x blocked`), **Skill** (name + capability icons), **Description**, **Source**.

Capability icons displayed next to skill names:

| Icon | Capability                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `>_` | `shell` — run shell commands             |
| `📂` | `filesystem` — read/write files          |
| `🌐` | `network` — outbound HTTP                |
| `🔍` | `browser` — browser automation           |
| `⚡` | `sessions` — cross-session orchestration |
| `✉️` | `messaging` — send channel messages      |
| `⏰` | `scheduling` — recurring jobs            |

Skills blocked by security scanning show `x blocked` instead of `x missing`.

Example output:

```

- disabled  old-skill                      Deprecated skill                     workspace
```

With `-v` (verbose), two extra columns appear — **Scan** and **Missing**:

```
Status      Skill              Description          Source              Scan        Missing
