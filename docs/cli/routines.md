# `openclaw routines`

Manage durable team-operation routines through the Gateway.

<Tip>
See [Routines](/automation/routines) for the conceptual guide. Schedule-triggered
routines use the same scheduler and run history as [cron jobs](/automation/cron-jobs);
message routines also use cron completion delivery.
</Tip>

## Usage

```bash
openclaw routines list [--all] [--agent <id>] [--query <text>] [--json]
openclaw routines get <id>
openclaw routines create <schedule> <message> --name <name> [options]
openclaw routines enable <id> [--json]
openclaw routines disable <id> [--json]
openclaw routines delete <id> [--json]
```

`create` is also available as `add`. `get` is also available as `show`.
`delete` is also available as `rm`.

## Create

```bash
openclaw routines create "0 9 * * 1-5" \
  --id "weekday-standup" \
  --name "Weekday standup" \
  --agent ops \
  --message "Review overnight updates and post the top priorities." \
  --announce \
  --channel telegram \
  --to "-1001234567890"
```

Schedule flags match `openclaw cron create`:

```bash
openclaw routines create --at "2026-08-01T17:00:00-07:00" \
  --name "Deployment follow-up" \
  --session main \
  --system-event "Check deployment status."

openclaw routines create --every "30m" \
  --name "Inbox triage" \
  --agent ops \
  --message "Review inbound items and flag blockers."

openclaw routines create --cron "0 18 * * 1-5" --tz America/Los_Angeles \
  --name "End-of-day digest" \
  --agent ops \
  --message "Summarize the day's completed and blocked work."
```

Main-session routines require `--system-event` and do not support completion
delivery flags. Isolated, current, and custom session routines require
`--message`. `current` binds to the owner/current session when the backing cron
job is created; `session:<id>` uses that persistent named session across runs.
Use `isolated` when each run should get a fresh cron-owned session. Announce
delivery requires `--session session:<id>`, `--session-key`, or a resolvable
`--to` destination; keyless `--to` values need `--channel` or a provider-prefixed
destination when multiple channels are configured. Otherwise message routines
default to no completion delivery.

## Idempotency

Pass `--id` when a script needs a human-chosen routine handle:

```bash
openclaw routines create --id "weekday-standup" ...
```

If the same id and same routine intent already exist, OpenClaw returns the
existing routine and does not create another cron job. If the id exists with
different intent, creation fails. When `--id` is omitted, OpenClaw derives a
stable id from the normalized routine intent so retrying the same create request
is still idempotent. For one-shot routines, pass an absolute `--at` timestamp;
relative `--at` durations are rejected because they resolve to a different
timestamp on every retry.

## Inspect

```bash
openclaw routines list --all
openclaw routines get weekday-standup
```

List output shows the routine status, next run, last run, schedule, and name.
`get` emits JSON and includes the backing cron job id under `trigger.cronJobId`.

## Enable, disable, delete

```bash
openclaw routines disable weekday-standup
openclaw routines enable weekday-standup
openclaw routines delete weekday-standup
```

Enable and disable update the backing cron job. Delete removes the backing cron
job before removing the routine record; if cron removal fails, the routine stays
registered so the delete can be retried. Repeating delete on an absent routine
returns a successful no-op result in JSON.
