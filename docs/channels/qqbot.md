title: QQ bot
---

QQ Bot connects to OpenClaw via the official QQ Bot API (WebSocket gateway).
C2C private chat and group `@`-mentions are the primary chat types, with rich
media (images, voice, video, files). Guild channel messages are supported for
text and remote-URL images only; voice, video, file uploads, and local/Base64
images are not available in guild channels. Reactions and threads are not
supported anywhere.

Status: official downloadable plugin.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @tencent-connect/openclaw-qqbot@2.0.0
```

OpenClaw pins the Tencent package version and integrity in its official plugin
catalog.

## Setup

1. Go to the [QQ Open Platform](https://q.qq.com/) and scan the QR code with your
   phone QQ to register / log in.
2. Click **Create Bot** to create a new QQ bot.
3. Find **AppID** and **AppSecret** on the bot's settings page and copy them.

<Note>
AppSecret is not stored in plaintext. If you leave the page without saving it, you'll have to regenerate a new one.
</Note>

4. Add the channel:

```bash
openclaw channels add --channel qqbot --token "AppID:AppSecret"
```

5. Restart the Gateway.

Interactive setup:

```bash
openclaw channels add
```

The wizard also offers QR-code binding as an alternative to typing AppID/AppSecret
manually: scan the code with the phone app tied to the target QQ Bot to complete
binding. OpenClaw persists the returned credentials under the account's config
scope.

## Configure

Minimal config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
      allowFrom: ["openclaw:approval-disabled"],
    },
  },
}
```

Default-account env vars (top-level account only):

- `QQBOT_APP_ID`
- `QQBOT_CLIENT_SECRET`

For an environment-only deployment, run `openclaw doctor --fix` once after
setting both variables. Doctor creates a credential-free `channels.qqbot`
shell, preserves open private-chat behavior, and locks native approval actions
until you configure explicit operator IDs in `allowFrom`.

File-backed AppSecret:

```json5
{
  secrets: {
    providers: {
      "qqbot-client-secret": {
        source: "file",
        path: "/path/to/qqbot-secret.txt",
        mode: "singleValue",
      },
    },
  },
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      clientSecret: {
        source: "file",
        provider: "qqbot-client-secret",
        id: "value",
      },
      allowFrom: ["openclaw:approval-disabled"],
    },
  },
}
```

Env SecretRef AppSecret:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      clientSecret: { source: "env", provider: "default", id: "QQBOT_CLIENT_SECRET" },
      allowFrom: ["openclaw:approval-disabled"],
    },
  },
}
```

Notes:

- Replace the `openclaw:approval-disabled` sentinel with concrete operator
  openids to enable native approval actions. Run `/bot-me` in a private chat to
  see your openid.
- `openclaw channels add --channel qqbot --token-file ...` sets the AppSecret
  only; `appId` must already be set in config or `QQBOT_APP_ID`.
- `clientSecret` accepts a plaintext string or a structured SecretRef object.
- Tencent QQBot 2.0 does not read `clientSecretFile`. `openclaw doctor --fix`
  migrates existing root/account file paths to file-backed SecretRefs without
  copying the secret into `openclaw.json`.
- Legacy `secretref:...` / `secretref-env:...` marker strings are rejected for
  `clientSecret`; use a structured SecretRef object instead.

### Streaming

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      streaming: {
        mode: "partial", // block streaming: "partial" (default) or "off"
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- `streaming.mode: "off"` disables block streaming for the account.
- Tencent QQBot 2.0 also accepts legacy `streaming: true|false` values, but the
  object form is the canonical OpenClaw configuration.
- `openclaw doctor --fix` removes retired `nativeTransport` / `c2cStreamApi`
  keys. It maps an explicitly disabled old native transport to `mode: "off"` so
  Tencent 2.0 does not unexpectedly enable its single C2C streaming transport.
  An enabled old native transport maps to `mode: "partial"` even if old block
  streaming was off, matching the bundled runtime's effective wire behavior.
- `/bot-streaming on|off` toggles the same config from a DM.

### Access policy

- `allowFrom` / `groupAllowFrom` gate who can chat with the bot in C2C /
  group contexts. `dmPolicy` / `groupPolicy` (`open` | `allowlist` | `disabled`)
  control the enforcement mode. `dmPolicy` defaults to `allowlist` once
  `allowFrom` has a concrete (non-wildcard) entry, otherwise `open`.
  `groupPolicy` defaults to `allowlist` once either `groupAllowFrom` or
  `allowFrom` has a concrete entry, otherwise `open`.
- "Auth: allowlist" slash commands require an explicit non-wildcard entry in
  `allowFrom` (or `groupAllowFrom` for group invocations) regardless of
  `dmPolicy` / `groupPolicy` — see [Slash commands](#slash-commands).

### Multi-account setup

Run multiple QQ bots under a single OpenClaw instance:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      enabled: true,
      appId: "111111111",
      clientSecret: "secret-of-bot-1",
      accounts: {
        bot2: {
          enabled: true,
          appId: "222222222",
          clientSecret: "secret-of-bot-2",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Each account owns an isolated WebSocket connection, API client, and token
cache, keyed by `appId`. Log lines are tagged with the owning account id so
diagnostics stay separable when you run several bots under one Gateway.

Add a second bot via CLI:

```bash
openclaw channels add --channel qqbot --account bot2 --token "222222222:secret-of-bot-2"
```

### Group chats

Group support uses QQ group OpenIDs, not display names. Add the bot to a
group, then mention it or configure the group to run without a mention.

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["member_openid"],
      groups: {
        "*": {
          requireMention: true,
          historyLimit: 50,
          toolPolicy: "restricted",
        },
        GROUP_OPENID: {
          name: "Release room",
          requireMention: false,
          ignoreOtherMentions: true,
          historyLimit: 20,
          prompt: "Keep replies short and operational.",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`groups["*"]` sets defaults for every group; a concrete `groups.GROUP_OPENID`
entry overrides those defaults for one group. Group settings:

| Field                 | Default          | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requireMention`      | `true`           | Require an `@`-mention before the bot replies.                                                 |
| `ignoreOtherMentions` | `false`          | Drop messages that mention someone else but not the bot.                                       |
| `historyLimit`        | `20`             | Recent non-mention messages kept as context for the next mentioned turn. `0` disables history. |
| `toolPolicy`          | `restricted`     | `full`, `restricted`, or `none`.                                                               |
| `name`                | openid prefix    | Friendly label used in logs and group context.                                                 |
| `prompt`              | built-in default | Per-group behavior prompt appended to the agent context.                                       |

When upgrading from the bundled QQBot plugin, `openclaw doctor --fix` maps the
former OpenClaw `tools` policies back to Tencent's `toolPolicy`. Exact `full`,
`restricted`, and `none` policies are preserved. Custom or per-sender policies
that Tencent 2.0 cannot express are migrated to `none` so the upgrade does not
broaden tool access. If both old and Tencent policy fields coexist, doctor keeps
the most restrictive result.

Tencent 2.0 cannot express the bundled plugin's per-group `commandLevel`.
Doctor removes `commandLevel: "all"` as redundant. If any group used `safety`,
`strict`, or an unknown value, doctor sets that account's `groupPolicy` to
`"disabled"`; review the combined group and command policy before re-enabling
group access.

Activation modes are `mention` and `always`. `requireMention: true` maps to
`mention`; `requireMention: false` maps to `always`. A session-level activation
override, when present, wins over config.

The inbound queue is per peer. Group peers get a larger queue cap (50 vs. 20
for direct peers), evict bot-authored messages before human ones when full,
and merge bursts of normal group messages into one attributed turn. Slash
commands run one by one, independent of any merge batch.

### Voice (STT / TTS)

STT and TTS support two-level configuration with priority fallback:

| Setting | Plugin-specific                                          | Framework fallback            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| STT     | `channels.qqbot.stt`                                     | `tools.media.audio.models[0]` |
| TTS     | `channels.qqbot.tts`, `channels.qqbot.accounts.<id>.tts` | `messages.tts`                |

```json5
{
  channels: {
    qqbot: {
      stt: {
        provider: "your-provider",
        model: "your-stt-model",
      },
      tts: {
        provider: "your-provider",
        model: "your-tts-model",
        voice: "your-voice",
      },
      accounts: {
        "qq-main": {
          tts: {
            providers: {
              openai: { voice: "shimmer" },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Set `enabled: false` on either to disable. Account-level TTS overrides use the
same shape as `messages.tts` and deep-merge over channel/global TTS config.

STT requests time out after 60 seconds by default. Plugin-specific STT uses the
selected `models.providers.<id>.timeoutSeconds` override. Framework audio STT
uses `tools.media.audio.models[0].timeoutSeconds`, then
`tools.media.audio.timeoutSeconds`, then the selected provider override.

Inbound QQ voice attachments are exposed to agents as audio media metadata
while keeping raw voice files out of generic `MediaPaths`. `[[audio_as_voice]]`
in a plain-text reply synthesizes TTS and sends a native QQ voice message when
TTS is configured.

Outbound audio upload/transcode behavior can also be tuned with
`channels.qqbot.audioFormatPolicy`:

- `sttDirectFormats`
- `uploadDirectFormats`
- `transcodeEnabled`

## Target formats

| Format                     | Description        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `qqbot:c2c:OPENID`         | Private chat (C2C) |
| `qqbot:group:GROUP_OPENID` | Group chat         |
| `qqbot:channel:CHANNEL_ID` | Guild channel      |

<Note>
Each bot has its own set of user OpenIDs. An OpenID received by Bot A **cannot** be used to send messages via Bot B.
</Note>

## Slash commands

Built-in commands intercepted before the AI queue:

| Command              | Auth      | Scope        | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/bot-ping`          | —         | any          | Latency test                                                                   |
| `/bot-help`          | —         | any          | List all commands                                                              |

| `/bot-logs`          | allowlist | private only | Export recent gateway logs as a file                                           |
| `/bot-clear-storage` | allowlist | private only | Delete cached downloads under the QQBot media directory                        |
| `/bot-streaming`     | allowlist | private only | Toggle C2C streaming replies                                                   |

| `/bot-pairing`       | allowlist | private only | Manage QQ Bot pairing settings                                                 |

Append `?` to any command for usage help (for example `/bot-upgrade ?`).

"Auth: allowlist" commands additionally require the sender's openid in an
explicit non-wildcard `allowFrom` list (`groupAllowFrom` takes precedence for
group-issued commands, falling back to `allowFrom`). A wildcard
`allowFrom: ["*"]` permits chat but not these commands. Running one of them
outside private chat, or without authorization, returns a hint rather than
silently dropping the message.

`/bot-me`, `/bot-version`, and `/bot-upgrade` are private-chat-only but do not
require the allowlist — any C2C sender can run them.

Tencent QQBot 2.0 authorizes native approval button clicks with `allowFrom`.
Use an explicit, non-wildcard list when native approvals are enabled; an empty
list or `"*"` allows any operator who can reach the button. During upgrade,
`openclaw doctor --fix` intersects legacy `execApprovals.approvers` with an
existing restrictive `allowFrom`. It also replaces implicit empty/wildcard
approval access with explicit IDs when present, or a non-matching marker.
Policies Tencent cannot represent (disabled, agent/session filters, or custom
targets) use the same lock until an operator reviews the new combined
chat/approval policy. The migration keeps previously open private chats open
with an explicit `dmPolicy: "open"`, and removes legacy `qqbot:` prefixes from
`allowFrom` and approver IDs.

## Media and storage

- Inbound, outbound, and gateway-bridge media share one payload root under
  `~/.openclaw/media/qqbot` (honoring `OPENCLAW_HOME` when set), so uploads,
  downloads, and transcode caches stay under one guarded directory.
- Rich media delivery for C2C and group targets goes through one `sendMedia`
  path. Local files and in-memory buffers of 5&nbsp;MiB or more use QQ's
  chunked upload endpoints; smaller payloads and remote-URL/Base64 sources use
  the one-shot upload API.
- If a hot upgrade interrupts the Gateway before it finishes writing
  `openclaw.json`, the plugin restores the last-known `appId` / `clientSecret`
  for that account from an internal snapshot on the next start (never
  overwriting an intentional config change), so re-scanning the QR code is not
  required.

## Troubleshooting

- **Gateway does not start / no inbound messages:** verify `appId` and
  `clientSecret` are correct and the bot is enabled on the QQ Open Platform.
  A missing credential surfaces as "QQBot not configured (missing appId or
  clientSecret)".
- **Setup with `--token-file` still shows unconfigured:** `--token-file` only
  sets the AppSecret. `appId` must still be set in config or `QQBOT_APP_ID`.
- **Bursty group replies collide:** the inbound queue evicts bot-authored
  messages ahead of human ones when a peer's queue fills up, and merges
  bursts of normal (non-command) group messages into one attributed turn, so
  a flood of bot chatter should not starve human messages.
- **Proactive messages not arriving:** QQ may block bot-initiated messages if
  the user has not interacted recently.
- **Voice not transcribed:** ensure STT is configured and the provider is
  reachable.
