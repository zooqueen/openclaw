title: "Chat channels"
---

OpenClaw can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

iMessage, Telegram, and the WebChat UI ship with the core install. Channels marked
"official plugin" install with one command (`openclaw plugins install @openclaw/<id>`)
or on demand during `openclaw onboard` / `openclaw channels add`, then need a Gateway
restart. "External plugin" channels are maintained outside the OpenClaw repo.

## Delivery notes

- Telegram replies that contain markdown image syntax, such as `![alt](url)`,
  are converted into media replies on the final outbound path when possible.
- Slack multi-person DMs route as group chats, so group policy, mention
  behavior, and group-session rules apply to MPIM conversations.
- WhatsApp setup is install-on-demand: onboarding can show the setup flow before
  the plugin package is installed, and the Gateway loads the external
  ClawHub/npm plugin only when the channel is actually active.
- Channels that accept bot-authored inbound messages can use shared
  [bot loop protection](/channels/bot-loop-protection) to prevent bot pairs from
  replying to each other indefinitely.
- Supported always-on rooms can use [ambient room events](/channels/ambient-room-events)
  so unmentioned room chatter becomes quiet context unless the agent sends with
  the `message` tool.

## Notes

- Channels can run simultaneously; configure multiple and OpenClaw will route per chat.
- Fastest setup is usually **Telegram** (simple bot token, no plugin install). WhatsApp
  requires QR pairing and stores more state on disk.
- Group behavior varies by channel; see [Groups](/channels/groups).
- DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](/gateway/security).
- Troubleshooting: [Channel troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).
- Model providers are documented separately; see [Model Providers](/providers/models).
