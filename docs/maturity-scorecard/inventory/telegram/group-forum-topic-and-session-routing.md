# Telegram - Conversation Routing and Delivery Maturity Note

## Summary

Telegram group, supergroup, forum-topic, and session-routing support is broad but
still one of the riskiest Telegram components. Source and docs cover group IDs,
mention gates, topic config, per-topic agents, ACP topic binding, and thread
aware session keys. Recent archive evidence still shows group and forum-topic
responses routing to the wrong place, so Quality stays Alpha.

## Normalization

Active category after channel taxonomy normalization.

- Normalized category: `Conversation Routing and Delivery`
- Merged from: `Access and Conversation Routing`, `Message Delivery and Rich Media`

## Archive Freshness

- gitcrawl: `gitcrawl doctor --json` succeeded with `version=0.2.1`, `last_sync_at=2026-05-28T19:09:52.784704Z`, `repository_count=2`, `thread_count=29810`, `open_thread_count=11181`, `cluster_count=18594`, `db_path=/Users/kevinlin/.config/gitcrawl/stores/gitcrawl-store/data/openclaw__openclaw.sync.db`, `api_supported=false`, `github_token_present=false`, and `openai_key_present=true`.
- discrawl: `discrawl status --json` succeeded with `state=current`, `generated_at=2026-05-30T14:10:20Z`, `last_sync_at=2026-05-29T19:27:40Z`, `messages=1487536`, `channels=25831`, `threads=25603`, `embedding_backlog=0`, `database_path=/Users/kevinlin/Library/Application Support/discrawl/discrawl.db`, `database_bytes=8035926016`, `share.remote=git@github.com-personal:openclaw/discord-store.git`, and `share.needs_update=true`.

## Coverage Score

- Score: `Beta (76%)`
- Positive signals:
  group config, group access, topic conversation IDs, thread bindings, route
  tests, and live group mention scenarios are all present.
- Negative signals:
  live proof is strong for bot-to-bot group mentions but thinner for forum
  topics, per-topic agents, ACP topic binding, group migration, and reply-chain
  recovery.
- Integration gaps:
  add recurring live proof for supergroup topics, General topic, DM topics,
  per-topic `agentId`, ACP topic binding, group migration, and route recovery
  after restart.

## Quality Score

- Score: `Alpha (68%)`
- Gitcrawl reports:
  #77576 and #86262 report Telegram group/topic replies routing through webchat
  or DM instead of Telegram; #80804 reports forum topic `sendMessage` failing
  with `chat not found`.
- Discrawl reports:
  release notes and user discussion call out Telegram forum-topic reliability,
  topic/progress fixes, and users relying on 1:1 groups with threads to work
  around DM-topic behavior.
- Good qualities:
  the routing model is explicit, deterministic, and topic-aware; docs warn about
  group IDs versus sender IDs and explain topic inheritance.
- Bad qualities:
  wrong-route regressions directly break the user-visible channel contract, and
  topic/session behavior is complex enough that operator expectations remain
  fragile.
- Excluded from quality:
  unit coverage, integration coverage, live QA breadth, and test count were not
  used as Quality inputs.

## Completeness Score

- Score: `Beta (76%)`
- Surface instructions: evaluated against `references/completeness/telegram.md`.
- Positive signals: archived docs, source, test, Gitcrawl, and Discrawl evidence cover the taxonomy scope for Conversation Routing and Delivery.
- Negative signals: the archived note predated process-version-3 Completeness scoring, so this score is initialized from the same evidence breadth and known-gap record used for the archived Coverage score.
- Missing capability branches: see `## Known Gaps` and `## Evidence` below for the recorded missing branches and operator-visible caveats.

## Known Gaps

- Promote forum-topic and per-topic-agent live scenarios into release smoke.
- Add direct diagnostics for "why did this group or topic reply route here?"
- Keep group/topic routing below core DM maturity until the open route
  regressions are closed.
