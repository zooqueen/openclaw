# Channel Message API

Channel plugins should expose one `message` adapter from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message`. The adapter describes the native message
lifecycle that the platform supports:

```text
receive -> route and record -> agent turn -> durable final send
send -> render batch -> platform I/O -> receipt -> lifecycle side effects
live preview -> final edit or fallback -> receipt
```

Core owns queueing, durability, generic retry policy, hooks, receipts, and the
shared `message` tool. The plugin owns native send/edit/delete calls, target
normalization, platform threading, selected quotes, notification flags, account
state, and platform-specific side effects.

Use this page together with [Building channel plugins](/plugins/sdk-channel-plugins).

The `channel-message` subpath is intentionally cheap enough for hot plugin
bootstrap files such as `channel.ts`: it exposes adapter contracts, capability
proofs, receipts, and compatibility facades without loading outbound delivery.
Runtime delivery helpers are available from
`openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message-runtime` for monitor/send code paths that
are already doing asynchronous message I/O.

## Minimal Adapter

Most new channel plugins can start with a small adapter:

```typescript
import {
  defineChannelMessageAdapter,
  createMessageReceiptFromOutboundResults,
} from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message";

export const demoMessageAdapter = defineChannelMessageAdapter({
  id: "demo",
  durableFinal: {
    capabilities: {
      text: true,
      replyTo: true,
      thread: true,
      messageSendingHooks: true,
    },
  },
  send: {
    text: async ({ cfg, to, text, accountId, replyToId, threadId, signal }) => {
      const sent = await sendDemoMessage({
        cfg,
        to,
        text,
        accountId: accountId ?? undefined,
        replyToId: replyToId ?? undefined,
        threadId: threadId == null ? undefined : String(threadId),
        signal,
      });

      return {
        receipt: createMessageReceiptFromOutboundResults({
          results: [{ channel: "demo", messageId: sent.id, conversationId: to }],
          kind: "text",
          threadId: threadId == null ? undefined : String(threadId),
          replyToId: replyToId ?? undefined,
        }),
      };
    },
  },
});
```

Then attach it to the channel plugin:

```typescript
export const demoPlugin = createChatChannelPlugin({
  base: {
    id: "demo",
    message: demoMessageAdapter,
    // other channel plugin fields
  },
});
```

Only declare capabilities that the adapter really preserves. Every declared
capability should have a contract test.

## Outbound Bridge

If the channel already has a compatible `outbound` adapter, prefer deriving the
message adapter instead of duplicating send code:

```typescript
import { createChannelMessageAdapterFromOutbound } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message";

const demoMessageAdapter = createChannelMessageAdapterFromOutbound({
  id: "demo",
  outbound: demoOutboundAdapter,
});
```

The bridge converts old outbound send results into `MessageReceipt` values. New
code should pass receipts end to end and only derive legacy ids at compatibility
edges with `listMessageReceiptPlatformIds(...)` or
`resolveMessageReceiptPrimaryId(...)`.
If no receive policy is supplied, `createChannelMessageAdapterFromOutbound(...)`
uses `manual` receive acknowledgement policy. That makes plugin-owned platform
acknowledgement explicit without changing channels that acknowledge webhooks,
sockets, or polling offsets outside generic receive context.

## Message Tool Sends

The shared `message(action="send")` path should use the same core delivery
lifecycle as final replies. If a channel needs provider-specific shaping for the
tool send, implement `actions.prepareSendPayload(...)` instead of sending from
`actions.handleAction(...)`.

`prepareSendPayload(...)` receives the normalized core `ReplyPayload` plus the
full action context. Return a payload with channel-specific data in
`payload.channelData.<channel>` and let core call `sendMessage(...)`,
`deliverOutboundPayloads(...)`, the write-ahead queue, message-sending hooks,
retry, recovery, and ack cleanup.

Return `null` only when the send cannot be represented as a durable payload, for
example because it contains a non-serializable component factory. Core will keep
the legacy plugin action fallback for compatibility, but new channel send
features should be expressible as durable payload data.

```typescript
export const demoActions: ChannelMessageActionAdapter = {
  describeMessageTool: () => ({ actions: ["send"], capabilities: ["presentation"] }),
  prepareSendPayload: ({ ctx, payload }) => {
    if (ctx.action !== "send") {
      return null;
    }
    return {
      ...payload,
      channelData: {
        ...payload.channelData,
        demo: {
          ...(payload.channelData?.demo as object | undefined),
          nativeCard: ctx.params.card,
        },
      },
    };
  },
};
```

The outbound adapter then reads `payload.channelData.demo` inside `sendPayload`.
This keeps platform-specific rendering in the plugin while core still owns
persist, retry, recover, hooks, and ack.

Prepared `message(action="send")` payloads and generic final-reply delivery use
core delivery with best-effort queueing by default. Required durable queueing is
only valid after core verifies the channel can reconcile a send whose outcome is
unknown after a crash. If the adapter cannot implement `reconcileUnknownSend`,
keep the prepared send path best-effort; core will still try the write-ahead
queue, but queue persistence or uncertain crash recovery is not part of the
required delivery contract.

## Durable Final Capabilities

Durable final delivery is opt in per side effect. Core will only use generic
durable delivery when the adapter declares every capability needed by the
payload and delivery options.

| Capability             | Declare when                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `text`                 | The adapter can send text and return a receipt.                                      |
| `media`                | Media sends return receipts for every visible platform message.                      |
| `payload`              | The adapter preserves rich reply payload semantics, not only text and one media URL. |
| `replyTo`              | Native reply targets reach the platform.                                             |
| `thread`               | Native thread, topic, or channel thread targets reach the platform.                  |
| `silent`               | Notification suppression reaches the platform.                                       |
| `nativeQuote`          | Selected quote metadata reaches the platform.                                        |
| `messageSendingHooks`  | Core message-sending hooks can cancel or rewrite content before platform I/O.        |
| `batch`                | Multi-part rendered batches are replayable as one durable plan.                      |
| `reconcileUnknownSend` | The adapter can resolve `unknown_after_send` recovery without blind replay.          |
| `afterSendSuccess`     | Channel-local after-send side effects run once.                                      |
| `afterCommit`          | Channel-local after-commit side effects run once.                                    |

Best-effort final delivery does not require `reconcileUnknownSend`; it uses the
shared lifecycle when the adapter preserves the payload's visible semantics, and
falls back to direct platform I/O if queue persistence is unavailable. Required
durable final delivery must explicitly require `reconcileUnknownSend`. If the
adapter cannot determine whether a started/unknown send reached the platform,
do not declare that capability; core will reject required durable delivery
before queueing.

When a caller needs durable delivery, derive requirements instead of building
maps by hand:

```typescript
import { deriveDurableFinalDeliveryRequirements } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message";

const requiredCapabilities = deriveDurableFinalDeliveryRequirements({
  payload,
  replyToId,
  threadId,
  silent,
  payloadTransport: true,
  extraCapabilities: {
    nativeQuote: hasSelectedQuote(payload),
  },
});
```

`messageSendingHooks` is required by default. Set `messageSendingHooks: false`
only for a path that intentionally cannot run global message-sending hooks.

## Durable Send Contract

A durable final send has stricter semantics than legacy channel-owned delivery:

- Create the durable intent before platform I/O.
- If durable delivery returns a handled result, do not fall back to legacy send.
- Treat hook cancellation and no-send results as terminal.
- Treat `unsupported` as a pre-intent result only.
- For required durability, fail before platform I/O if the queue cannot record
  that platform send has started.
- For required final delivery and required prepared message-tool sends,
  preflight `reconcileUnknownSend`; recovery must be able to ack an
  already-sent message or replay only after the adapter proves the original send
  did not happen.
- For `best_effort`, queue write failures may fall back to direct platform I/O.
- Forward abort signals to media loading and platform sends.
- Run after-commit hooks after queue ack; direct best-effort fallback runs them
  after successful platform I/O because there is no durable queue commit.
- Return receipts for every visible platform message id.
- Use `reconcileUnknownSend` when a platform can check whether an uncertain send
  already reached the user.

This contract avoids duplicate sends after crashes and avoids bypassing
message-sending cancellation hooks.

## Receipts

`MessageReceipt` is the new internal record of what the platform accepted:

```typescript
type MessageReceipt = {
  primaryPlatformMessageId?: string;
  platformMessageIds: string[];
  parts: MessageReceiptPart[];
  threadId?: string;
  replyToId?: string;
  editToken?: string;
  deleteToken?: string;
  sentAt: number;
  raw?: readonly MessageReceiptSourceResult[];
};
```

Use `createMessageReceiptFromOutboundResults(...)` when adapting an existing
send result. Use `createPreviewMessageReceipt(...)` when a live preview message
becomes the final receipt. Avoid adding new owner-local `messageIds` fields.
Legacy `ChannelDeliveryResult.messageIds` is still produced at compatibility
edges.

## Live Preview

Channels that stream draft previews or progress updates should declare live
capabilities:

```typescript
const demoMessageAdapter = defineChannelMessageAdapter({
  id: "demo",
  live: {
    capabilities: {
      draftPreview: true,
      previewFinalization: true,
      progressUpdates: true,
      quietFinalization: true,
    },
    finalizer: {
      capabilities: {
        finalEdit: true,
        normalFallback: true,
        discardPending: true,
        previewReceipt: true,
        retainOnAmbiguousFailure: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Use `defineFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter(...)` and
`deliverWithFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter(...)` for runtime finalization. The
finalizer decides whether the final reply edits the preview in place, sends a
normal fallback, discards pending preview state, keeps an ambiguous failed edit
without duplicating the message, and returns the final receipt.

## Receive Ack Policy

Inbound receivers that control platform acknowledgement timing should declare
receive policy:

```typescript
const demoMessageAdapter = defineChannelMessageAdapter({
  id: "demo",
  receive: {
    defaultAckPolicy: "after_agent_dispatch",
    supportedAckPolicies: ["after_receive_record", "after_agent_dispatch"],
  },
});
```

Adapters that do not declare receive policy default to:

```typescript
{
  receive: {
    defaultAckPolicy: "manual",
    supportedAckPolicies: ["manual"],
  },
}
```

Use the default when the platform has no acknowledgement to defer, already
acknowledges before asynchronous processing, or needs protocol-specific response
semantics. Declare one of the staged policies only when the receiver actually
uses receive context to move platform acknowledgement later.

Policies:

| Policy                 | Use when                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `after_receive_record` | The platform can be acknowledged after the inbound event is parsed and recorded.         |
| `after_agent_dispatch` | The platform should wait until the agent dispatch has been accepted.                     |
| `after_durable_send`   | The platform should wait until final delivery has a durable decision.                    |
| `manual`               | The plugin owns acknowledgement because platform semantics do not match a generic stage. |

Use `createMessageReceiveContext(...)` in receivers that defer ack state, and
`shouldAckMessageAfterStage(...)` when the receiver needs to test whether a
stage has satisfied the configured policy.

## Contract Tests

Capability declarations are part of the plugin contract. Back them with tests:

```typescript
import {
  verifyChannelMessageAdapterCapabilityProofs,
  verifyChannelMessageLiveCapabilityAdapterProofs,
  verifyChannelMessageLiveFinalizerProofs,
  verifyChannelMessageReceiveAckPolicyAdapterProofs,
} from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message";

it("backs declared message capabilities", async () => {
  await expect(
    verifyChannelMessageAdapterCapabilityProofs({
      adapterName: "demo",
      adapter: demoMessageAdapter,
      proofs: {
        text: async () => {
          const result = await demoMessageAdapter.send!.text!(textCtx);
          expect(result.receipt.platformMessageIds).toContain("msg-1");
        },
        replyTo: async () => {
          await demoMessageAdapter.send!.text!({ ...textCtx, replyToId: "parent-1" });
          expect(sendDemoMessage).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
            expect.objectContaining({
              replyToId: "parent-1",
            }),
          );
        },
        messageSendingHooks: () => {
          expect(demoMessageAdapter.durableFinal!.capabilities!.messageSendingHooks).toBe(true);
        },
      },
    }),
  ).resolves.toContainEqual({ capability: "text", status: "verified" });
});
```

Add live and receive proof suites when the adapter declares those features. A
missing proof should fail the test rather than silently widening the durable
surface.

## Deprecated Compatibility APIs

These APIs remain importable for third-party compatibility. Do not use them for
new channel code.

| Deprecated API                               | Replacement                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-reply-pipeline` | `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message`                                                                               |
| `createChannelTurnReplyPipeline(...)`        | `createChannelMessageReplyPipeline(...)` for compatibility dispatchers, or a `message` adapter for new channel code |
| `deliverDurableInboundReplyPayload(...)`     | `deliverInboundReplyWithMessageSendContext(...)` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/channel-message-runtime`                 |
| `dispatchInboundReplyWithBase(...)`          | `dispatchChannelMessageReplyWithBase(...)` only for compatibility dispatchers                                       |
| `recordInboundSessionAndDispatchReply(...)`  | `recordChannelMessageReplyDispatch(...)` only for compatibility dispatchers                                         |
| `resolveChannelSourceReplyDeliveryMode(...)` | `resolveChannelMessageSourceReplyDeliveryMode(...)`                                                                 |
| `deliverFinalizableDraftPreview(...)`        | `defineFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter(...)` plus `deliverWithFinalizableLivePreviewAdapter(...)`                     |
| `DraftPreviewFinalizerDraft`                 | `LivePreviewFinalizerDraft`                                                                                         |
| `DraftPreviewFinalizerResult`                | `LivePreviewFinalizerResult`                                                                                        |

Compatibility dispatchers can still use `createReplyPrefixContext(...)`,
`createReplyPrefixOptions(...)`, and `createTypingCallbacks(...)` through the
message facade. New lifecycle code should avoid the old
`channel-reply-pipeline` subpath.

## Migration Checklist

1. Add `message: defineChannelMessageAdapter(...)` or
   `message: createChannelMessageAdapterFromOutbound(...)` to the channel plugin.
2. Return `MessageReceipt` from text, media, and payload sends.
3. Declare only capabilities backed by native behavior and tests.
4. Replace hand-written durable requirement maps with
   `deriveDurableFinalDeliveryRequirements(...)`.
5. Move preview finalization through the live preview helpers when the channel
   edits draft messages in place.
6. Declare receive ack policy only when the receiver can really defer platform
   acknowledgement.
7. Keep legacy reply dispatch helpers only at compatibility edges.
