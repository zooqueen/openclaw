# Plugin dependency resolution

OpenClaw keeps plugin dependency work at install/update time. Runtime loading
does not run package managers, repair dependency trees, or mutate the OpenClaw
package directory.

## Responsibility split

Plugin packages own their dependency graph:

- runtime dependencies live in the plugin package `dependencies` or
  `optionalDependencies`
- SDK/core imports are peer or supplied OpenClaw imports
- local development plugins bring their own already-installed dependencies
- npm and git plugins are installed into OpenClaw-owned package roots

OpenClaw owns only the plugin lifecycle:

- discover the plugin source
- install or update the package when explicitly requested
- record the install metadata
- load the plugin entrypoint
- fail with an actionable error when dependencies are missing

## Install roots

OpenClaw uses stable per-source roots:

- npm packages install under `~/.openclaw/npm`
- git packages clone under `~/.openclaw/git`
- local/path/archive installs are copied or referenced without dependency repair

npm installs run in the npm root with:

```bash
npm install --prefix ~/.openclaw/npm <spec> --omit=dev --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

git installs clone or refresh the repository, then run:

```bash
npm install --omit=dev --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

The installed plugin then loads from that package directory, so package-local
`node_modules` resolution works the same way it does for a normal Node package.

## Local plugins

Local plugins are treated as developer-controlled directories. OpenClaw does not
run `npm install`, `pnpm install`, or dependency repair for them. If a local
plugin has dependencies, install them in that plugin before loading it.

Third-party TypeScript local plugins can use the emergency Jiti path. Packaged
JavaScript plugins and bundled internal plugins load through native
import/require instead of Jiti.

## Startup and reload

Gateway startup and config reload never install plugin dependencies. They read
the plugin install records, compute the entrypoint, and load it.

If a dependency is missing at runtime, the plugin fails to load and the error
should point the operator to an explicit fix:

```bash
openclaw plugins update <id>
openclaw plugins install <source>
openclaw doctor --fix
```

`doctor --fix` can clean legacy OpenClaw-generated dependency state and install
configured downloadable plugins that are missing from the local install records.
It does not repair dependencies for an already-installed local plugin.

## Bundled plugins

Lightweight and core-critical bundled plugins are shipped as part of OpenClaw.
They should either have no heavy runtime dependency tree or be moved out to a
downloadable package on ClawHub/npm.

Bundled plugin manifests must not request dependency staging. Large or optional
plugin functionality should be packaged as a normal plugin and installed through
the same npm/git/ClawHub path as third-party plugins.

In source checkouts, OpenClaw treats the repository as a pnpm monorepo. After
`pnpm install`, bundled plugins load from `extensions/<id>` so package-local
workspace dependencies are available and edits are picked up directly. Source
checkout development is pnpm-only; plain `npm install` at the repository root is
not a supported way to prepare bundled plugin dependencies.

| Install shape                    | Bundled plugin location               | Dependency owner                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install -g openclaw`        | Built runtime tree inside the package | OpenClaw package and explicit plugin install/update/doctor flows     |
| Git checkout plus `pnpm install` | `extensions/<id>` workspace packages  | The pnpm workspace, including each plugin package's own dependencies |
| `openclaw plugins install ...`   | Managed npm/git/ClawHub plugin root   | The plugin install/update flow                                       |

## Legacy cleanup

Older OpenClaw versions generated bundled-plugin dependency roots at startup or
during doctor repair. Current doctor cleanup removes those stale directories and
symlinks when `--fix` is used, including old `plugin-runtime-deps` roots,
`.openclaw-runtime-deps*` manifests, generated plugin `node_modules`, install
stage directories, and package-local pnpm stores.

These paths are legacy debris only. New installs should not create them.
