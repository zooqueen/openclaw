title: "Codex harness"
read_when:
  - You want to use the bundled Codex app-server harness
  - You need Codex model refs and config examples
  - You want to disable PI fallback for Codex-only deployments
---

The bundled `codex` plugin lets OpenClaw run embedded agent turns through the
Codex app-server instead of the built-in PI harness.

Use this when you want Codex to own the low-level agent session: model
discovery, native thread resume, native compaction, and app-server execution.
OpenClaw still owns chat channels, session files, model selection, tools,
approvals, media delivery, and the visible transcript mirror.

Native Codex turns also respect the shared plugin hooks so prompt shims,
compaction-aware automation, tool middleware, and lifecycle observers stay
aligned with the PI harness:

- `before_prompt_build`
- `before_compaction`, `after_compaction`
- `llm_input`, `llm_output`
- `tool_result`, `after_tool_call`
- `before_message_write`
- `agent_end`

Bundled plugins can also register a Codex app-server extension factory to add
async `tool_result` middleware.

The harness is off by default. New configs should keep OpenAI model refs
canonical as `openai/gpt-*` and explicitly force
`embeddedHarness.runtime: "codex"` or `OPENCLAW_AGENT_RUNTIME=codex` when they
want native app-server execution. Legacy `codex/*` model refs still auto-select
the harness for compatibility.

## Pick the right model prefix

OpenClaw now keeps OpenAI GPT model refs canonical as `openai/*`:

| Model ref                                             | Runtime path                                 | Use when                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openai/gpt-5.5`                                      | OpenAI provider through OpenClaw/PI plumbing | You want direct OpenAI Platform API access with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.       |
| `openai/gpt-5.5` + `embeddedHarness.runtime: "codex"` | Codex app-server harness                     | You want native Codex app-server execution for the embedded agent turn. |

Legacy `openai-codex/gpt-*` and `codex/gpt-*` refs remain accepted as
compatibility aliases, but new docs/config examples should use `openai/gpt-*`.

Use `/status` to confirm the effective harness for the current session. If the
selection is surprising, enable debug logging for the `agents/harness` subsystem
and inspect the gateway's structured `agent harness selected` record. It
includes the selected harness id, selection reason, runtime/fallback policy, and,
in `auto` mode, each plugin candidate's support result.

Harness selection is not a live session control. When an embedded turn runs,
OpenClaw records the selected harness id on that session and keeps using it for
later turns in the same session id. Change `embeddedHarness` config or
`OPENCLAW_AGENT_RUNTIME` when you want future sessions to use another harness;
use `/new` or `/reset` to start a fresh session before switching an existing
conversation between PI and Codex. This avoids replaying one transcript through
two incompatible native session systems.

Legacy sessions created before harness pins are treated as PI-pinned once they
have transcript history. Use `/new` or `/reset` to opt that conversation into
Codex after changing config.

`/status` shows the effective non-PI harness next to `Fast`, for example
`Fast · codex`. The default PI harness remains `Runner: pi (embedded)` and does
not add a separate harness badge.

## Requirements

- OpenClaw with the bundled `codex` plugin available.
- Codex app-server `0.118.0` or newer.
- Codex auth available to the app-server process.

The plugin blocks older or unversioned app-server handshakes. That keeps
OpenClaw on the protocol surface it has been tested against.

For live and Docker smoke tests, auth usually comes from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, plus
optional Codex CLI files such as `~/.codex/auth.json` and
`~/.codex/config.toml`. Use the same auth material your local Codex app-server
uses.

## Minimal config

Use `openai/gpt-5.5`, enable the bundled plugin, and force the `codex` harness:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: "openai/gpt-5.5",
      embeddedHarness: {
        runtime: "codex",
        fallback: "none",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

If your config uses `plugins.allow`, include `codex` there too:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    allow: ["codex"],
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Legacy configs that set `agents.defaults.model` or an agent model to
`codex/<model>` still auto-enable the bundled `codex` plugin. New configs should
prefer `openai/<model>` plus the explicit `embeddedHarness` entry above.

## Add Codex without replacing other models

Keep `runtime: "auto"` when you want legacy `codex/*` refs to select Codex and
PI for everything else. For new configs, prefer explicit `runtime: "codex"` on
the agents that should use the harness.

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "openai/gpt-5.5",
        fallbacks: ["openai/gpt-5.5", "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"],
      },
      models: {
        "openai/gpt-5.5": { alias: "gpt" },
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": { alias: "opus" },
      },
      embeddedHarness: {
        runtime: "codex",
        fallback: "pi",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

With this shape:

- `/model gpt` or `/model openai/gpt-5.5` uses the Codex app-server harness for this config.
- `/model opus` uses the Anthropic provider path.
- If a non-Codex model is selected, PI remains the compatibility harness.

## Codex-only deployments

Disable PI fallback when you need to prove that every embedded agent turn uses
the Codex harness:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: "openai/gpt-5.5",
      embeddedHarness: {
        runtime: "codex",
        fallback: "none",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Environment override:

```bash
OPENCLAW_AGENT_RUNTIME=codex \
OPENCLAW_AGENT_HARNESS_FALLBACK=none \
openclaw gateway run
```

With fallback disabled, OpenClaw fails early if the Codex plugin is disabled,
the app-server is too old, or the app-server cannot start.

## Per-agent Codex

You can make one agent Codex-only while the default agent keeps normal
auto-selection:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      embeddedHarness: {
        runtime: "auto",
        fallback: "pi",
      },
    },
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        default: true,
        model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6",
      },
      {
        id: "codex",
        name: "Codex",
        model: "openai/gpt-5.5",
        embeddedHarness: {
          runtime: "codex",
          fallback: "none",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Use normal session commands to switch agents and models. `/new` creates a fresh
OpenClaw session and the Codex harness creates or resumes its sidecar app-server
thread as needed. `/reset` clears the OpenClaw session binding for that thread
and lets the next turn resolve the harness from current config again.

## Model discovery

By default, the Codex plugin asks the app-server for available models. If
discovery fails or times out, it uses a bundled fallback catalog for:

- GPT-5.5
- GPT-5.4 mini
- GPT-5.2

You can tune discovery under `plugins.entries.codex.config.discovery`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          discovery: {
            enabled: true,
            timeoutMs: 2500,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Disable discovery when you want startup to avoid probing Codex and stick to the
fallback catalog:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          discovery: {
            enabled: false,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## App-server connection and policy

By default, the plugin starts Codex locally with:

```bash
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

By default, OpenClaw starts local Codex harness sessions in YOLO mode:
`approvalPolicy: "never"`, `approvalsReviewer: "user"`, and
`sandbox: "danger-full-access"`. This is the trusted local operator posture used
for autonomous heartbeats: Codex can use shell and network tools without
stopping on native approval prompts that nobody is around to answer.

To opt in to Codex guardian-reviewed approvals, set `appServer.mode:
"guardian"`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          appServer: {
            mode: "guardian",
            serviceTier: "fast",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Guardian is a native Codex approval reviewer. When Codex asks to leave the sandbox, write outside the workspace, or add permissions like network access, Codex routes that approval request to a reviewer subagent instead of a human prompt. The reviewer applies Codex's risk framework and approves or denies the specific request. Use Guardian when you want more guardrails than YOLO mode but still need unattended agents to make progress.

The `guardian` preset expands to `approvalPolicy: "on-request"`, `approvalsReviewer: "guardian_subagent"`, and `sandbox: "workspace-write"`. Individual policy fields still override `mode`, so advanced deployments can mix the preset with explicit choices.

For an already-running app-server, use WebSocket transport:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          appServer: {
            transport: "websocket",
            url: "ws://127.0.0.1:39175",
            authToken: "${CODEX_APP_SERVER_TOKEN}",
            requestTimeoutMs: 60000,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Supported `appServer` fields:

The older environment variables still work as fallbacks for local testing when
the matching config field is unset:

- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_BIN`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_ARGS`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE=yolo|guardian`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_APPROVAL_POLICY`
- `OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_SANDBOX`

`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_GUARDIAN=1` was removed. Use
`plugins.entries.codex.config.appServer.mode: "guardian"` instead, or
`OPENCLAW_CODEX_APP_SERVER_MODE=guardian` for one-off local testing. Config is
preferred for repeatable deployments because it keeps the plugin behavior in the
same reviewed file as the rest of the Codex harness setup.

## Common recipes

Local Codex with default stdio transport:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Codex-only harness validation, with PI fallback disabled:

```json5
{
  embeddedHarness: {
    fallback: "none",
  },
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Guardian-reviewed Codex approvals:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          appServer: {
            mode: "guardian",
            approvalPolicy: "on-request",
            approvalsReviewer: "guardian_subagent",
            sandbox: "workspace-write",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Remote app-server with explicit headers:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: {
      codex: {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          appServer: {
            transport: "websocket",
            url: "ws://gateway-host:39175",
            headers: {
              "X-OpenClaw-Agent": "main",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Model switching stays OpenClaw-controlled. When an OpenClaw session is attached
to an existing Codex thread, the next turn sends the currently selected
OpenAI model, provider, approval policy, sandbox, and service tier to
app-server again. Switching from `openai/gpt-5.5` to `openai/gpt-5.2` keeps the
thread binding but asks Codex to continue with the newly selected model.

## Codex command

The bundled plugin registers `/codex` as an authorized slash command. It is
generic and works on any channel that supports OpenClaw text commands.

Common forms:

- `/codex status` shows live app-server connectivity, models, account, rate limits, MCP servers, and skills.
- `/codex models` lists live Codex app-server models.
- `/codex threads [filter]` lists recent Codex threads.
- `/codex resume <thread-id>` attaches the current OpenClaw session to an existing Codex thread.
- `/codex compact` asks Codex app-server to compact the attached thread.
- `/codex review` starts Codex native review for the attached thread.
- `/codex account` shows account and rate-limit status.
- `/codex mcp` lists Codex app-server MCP server status.
- `/codex skills` lists Codex app-server skills.

`/codex resume` writes the same sidecar binding file that the harness uses for
normal turns. On the next message, OpenClaw resumes that Codex thread, passes the
currently selected OpenClaw model into app-server, and keeps extended history
enabled.

The command surface requires Codex app-server `0.118.0` or newer. Individual
control methods are reported as `unsupported by this Codex app-server` if a
future or custom app-server does not expose that JSON-RPC method.

## Tools, media, and compaction

The Codex harness changes the low-level embedded agent executor only.

OpenClaw still builds the tool list and receives dynamic tool results from the
harness. Text, images, video, music, TTS, approvals, and messaging-tool output
continue through the normal OpenClaw delivery path.

Codex MCP tool approval elicitations are routed through OpenClaw's plugin
approval flow when Codex marks `_meta.codex_approval_kind` as
`"mcp_tool_call"`; other elicitation and free-form input requests still fail
closed.

When the selected model uses the Codex harness, native thread compaction is
delegated to Codex app-server. OpenClaw keeps a transcript mirror for channel
history, search, `/new`, `/reset`, and future model or harness switching. The
mirror includes the user prompt, final assistant text, and lightweight Codex
reasoning or plan records when the app-server emits them. Today, OpenClaw only
records native compaction start and completion signals. It does not yet expose a
human-readable compaction summary or an auditable list of which entries Codex
kept after compaction.

Media generation does not require PI. Image, video, music, PDF, TTS, and media
understanding continue to use the matching provider/model settings such as
`agents.defaults.imageGenerationModel`, `videoGenerationModel`, `pdfModel`, and
`messages.tts`.

## Troubleshooting

**Codex does not appear in `/model`:** enable `plugins.entries.codex.enabled`,
select an `openai/gpt-*` model with `embeddedHarness.runtime: "codex"` (or a
legacy `codex/*` ref), and check whether `plugins.allow` excludes `codex`.

**OpenClaw uses PI instead of Codex:** if no Codex harness claims the run,
OpenClaw may use PI as the compatibility backend. Set
`embeddedHarness.runtime: "codex"` to force Codex selection while testing, or
`embeddedHarness.fallback: "none"` to fail when no plugin harness matches. Once
Codex app-server is selected, its failures surface directly without extra
fallback config.

**The app-server is rejected:** upgrade Codex so the app-server handshake
reports version `0.118.0` or newer.

**Model discovery is slow:** lower `plugins.entries.codex.config.discovery.timeoutMs`
or disable discovery.

**WebSocket transport fails immediately:** check `appServer.url`, `authToken`,
and that the remote app-server speaks the same Codex app-server protocol version.

**A non-Codex model uses PI:** that is expected unless you forced
`embeddedHarness.runtime: "codex"` (or selected a legacy `codex/*` ref). Plain
`openai/gpt-*` and other provider refs stay on their normal provider path.
