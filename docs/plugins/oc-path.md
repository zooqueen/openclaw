summary: "Bundled `oc-path` plugin: ships the `openclaw path` CLI for the `oc://` workspace-file addressing scheme"
read_when:
  - You want to inspect or edit a single leaf inside a workspace file from the terminal
  - You are scripting against workspace state and need a stable, kind-agnostic addressing scheme
  - You are deciding whether to enable the optional `oc-path` plugin on a self-hosted Gateway
title: "OC Path plugin"
---

The bundled `oc-path` plugin adds the [`openclaw path`](/cli/path) CLI for the
`oc://` workspace-file addressing scheme. It ships in the OpenClaw repo under
`extensions/oc-path/` but is opt-in — install/build leaves it dormant until you
enable it.

`oc://` addresses point at a single leaf (or a wildcard set of leaves) inside
a workspace file. The plugin understands three kinds of files today:

- **markdown** (`.md`, `.mdx`): frontmatter, sections, items, fields
- **jsonc** (`.jsonc`, `.json5`, `.json`): comments and formatting preserved
- **jsonl** (`.jsonl`, `.ndjson`): line-oriented records

Self-hosters and editor extensions use the CLI to read or write a single leaf
without scripting against the SDK directly; agents and hooks treat it as a
deterministic substrate so byte-fidelity round-trips and the redaction
sentinel guard apply uniformly across kinds.

## Why enable it

Enable `oc-path` when you want scripts, hooks, or local agent tooling to point
at a precise piece of workspace state without inventing a parser for each file
shape. A single `oc://` address can name a markdown frontmatter key, a section
item, a JSONC config leaf, or a JSONL event field.

That matters for maintainer workflows where the change should be small,
auditable, and repeatable: inspect one value, find matching records, dry-run a
write, then apply only that leaf while leaving comments, line endings, and
nearby formatting alone. Keeping this as an opt-in plugin gives power users the
addressing substrate without putting parser dependencies or CLI surface into
core for installs that never need it.

## Where it runs

The plugin runs **in-process inside the `openclaw` CLI** on the host where you
invoke the command. It does not need a running Gateway and does not open any
network sockets — every verb is a pure transform over a file you point it at.

The plugin metadata lives in `extensions/oc-path/openclaw.plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "oc-path",
  "name": "OC Path",
  "activation": {
    "onStartup": false,
    "onCommands": ["path"]
  },
  "commandAliases": [{ "name": "path", "kind": "cli" }]
}
```

`onStartup: false` keeps the plugin out of the Gateway hot path. `onCommands:
["path"]` tells the CLI to load the plugin lazily the first time you run
`openclaw path …`, so installs that never use the verb pay no cost.

## Enable

```bash
openclaw plugins enable oc-path
```

Restart the Gateway (if you run one) so the manifest snapshot picks up the new
state. Bare `openclaw path` invocations work immediately on the same host —
the CLI loads the plugin on demand.

Disable with:

```bash
openclaw plugins disable oc-path
```

## Dependencies

All parser dependencies are plugin-local — enabling `oc-path` does not pull
new packages into the core runtime:

| Dependency     | Purpose                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commander`    | Subcommand wiring for `resolve`, `find`, `set`, `validate`, `emit`. |
| `jsonc-parser` | JSONC parse + leaf edits with comments and trailing commas kept.    |
| `markdown-it`  | Markdown tokenization for the section / item / field model.         |

JSONL stays hand-rolled — line-oriented parsing is simpler than any
dependency, and the per-line JSONC parse already goes through `jsonc-parser`.

## What it provides

| Surface                        | Provided by                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openclaw path` CLI            | `extensions/oc-path/cli-registration.ts`                |
| `oc://` parser / formatter     | `extensions/oc-path/src/oc-path/oc-path.ts`             |
| Per-kind parse / emit / edit   | `extensions/oc-path/src/oc-path/{md,jsonc,jsonl}`       |
| Universal resolve / find / set | `extensions/oc-path/src/oc-path/{resolve,find,edit}.ts` |
| Redaction-sentinel guard       | `extensions/oc-path/src/oc-path/sentinel.ts`            |

The CLI is the only public surface today. The substrate verbs are private to
the plugin; consumers use the CLI (or build their own plugin against the SDK).

## Relationship to other plugins

- **`memory-*`**: memory writes go through the memory plugins, not `oc-path`.
  `oc-path` is a generic file substrate; memory plugins layer their own
  semantics on top.
- **LKG**: `path` does not know about Last-Known-Good config restore. If a
  file is LKG-tracked, the next `observe` call decides whether to promote or
  recover; `set --batch` for atomic multi-set through the LKG promote/recover
  lifecycle is planned alongside the LKG-recovery substrate.

## Safety

`set` writes raw bytes through the substrate's emit path, which applies the
redaction-sentinel guard automatically. A leaf carrying
`__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` (verbatim or as a substring) is refused at write time
with `OC_EMIT_SENTINEL`. The CLI also scrubs the literal sentinel from any
human or JSON output it prints, replacing it with `[REDACTED]` so terminal
captures and pipelines never leak the marker.
