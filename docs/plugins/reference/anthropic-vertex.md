# Anthropic Vertex plugin

OpenClaw Anthropic Vertex provider plugin for Claude models on Google Vertex AI.

## Distribution

- Package: `@openclaw/anthropic-vertex-provider`
- Install route: npm; ClawHub

## Surface

providers: anthropic-vertex

<!-- openclaw-plugin-reference:manual-start -->

## Claude Fable 5

Use `anthropic-vertex/claude-fable-5` where the model is available in your Google Cloud region.
Fable 5 always uses adaptive thinking and defaults to `high` effort. `/think off` and
`/think minimal` use `low` effort because the model does not support disabling thinking.

## Claude Sonnet 5

Use `anthropic-vertex/claude-sonnet-5` with Vertex's `global`, `us`, or `eu`
endpoint. Sonnet 5 defaults to adaptive thinking at `high` effort and supports
`/think off` or the native `/think xhigh|max` levels. OpenClaw publishes its
1,000,000-token context window and 128,000-token output limit automatically.

Catalog pricing follows Vertex's introductory global rate of `$2/$10` per
million input/output tokens through August 31, 2026, then `$3/$15` from
September 1. The `us` and `eu` multi-region endpoints use Vertex's documented
10% premium.
