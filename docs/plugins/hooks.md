summary: "Plugin hooks: intercept agent, tool, message, session, and Gateway lifecycle events"
title: "Plugin hooks"
read_when:
  - You are building a plugin that needs before_tool_call, before_agent_reply, message hooks, or lifecycle hooks
  - You need to block, rewrite, or require approval for tool calls from a plugin
  - You are deciding between internal hooks and plugin hooks
---

Plugin hooks are in-process extension points for OpenClaw plugins. Use them
when a plugin needs to inspect or change agent runs, tool calls, message flow,
session lifecycle, subagent routing, installs, or Gateway startup.

Use [internal hooks](/automation/hooks) instead when you want a small
operator-installed `HOOK.md` script for command and Gateway events such as
`/new`, `/reset`, `/stop`, `agent:bootstrap`, or `gateway:startup`.

## Quick start

Register typed plugin hooks with `api.on(...)` from your plugin entry:

```typescript
import { definePluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry";

export default definePluginEntry({
  id: "tool-preflight",
  name: "Tool Preflight",
  register(api) {
    api.on(
      "before_tool_call",
      async (event) => {
        if (event.toolName !== "web_search") {
          return;
        }

        return {
          requireApproval: {
            title: "Run web search",
            description: `Allow search query: ${String(event.params.query ?? "")}`,
            severity: "info",
            timeoutMs: 60_000,
            timeoutBehavior: "deny",
          },
        };
      },
      { priority: 50 },
    );
  },
});
```

Hook handlers run sequentially in descending `priority`. Same-priority hooks
keep registration order.

Each hook receives `event.context.pluginConfig`, the resolved config for the
plugin that registered that handler. Use it for hook decisions that need
current plugin options; OpenClaw injects it per handler without mutating the
shared event object seen by other plugins.

## Hook catalog

Hooks are grouped by the surface they extend. Names in **bold** accept a
decision result (block, cancel, override, or require approval); all others are
observation-only.

**Agent turn**

- `before_model_resolve` — override provider or model before session messages load
- `agent_turn_prepare` — consume queued plugin turn injections and add same-turn context before prompt hooks
- `before_prompt_build` — add dynamic context or system-prompt text before the model call
- `before_agent_start` — compatibility-only combined phase; prefer the two hooks above
- **`before_agent_reply`** — short-circuit the model turn with a synthetic reply or silence
- **`before_agent_finalize`** — inspect the natural final answer and request one more model pass
- `agent_end` — observe final messages, success state, and run duration
- `heartbeat_prompt_contribution` — add heartbeat-only context for background monitor and lifecycle plugins

**Conversation observation**

- `model_call_started` / `model_call_ended` — observe sanitized provider/model call metadata, timing, outcome, and bounded request-id hashes without prompt or response content
- `llm_input` — observe provider input (system prompt, prompt, history)
- `llm_output` — observe provider output

**Tools**

- **`before_tool_call`** — rewrite tool params, block execution, or require approval
- `after_tool_call` — observe tool results, errors, and duration
- **`tool_result_persist`** — rewrite the assistant message produced from a tool result
- **`before_message_write`** — inspect or block an in-progress message write (rare)

**Messages and delivery**

- **`inbound_claim`** — claim an inbound message before agent routing (synthetic replies)
- `message_received` — observe inbound content, sender, thread, and metadata
- **`message_sending`** — rewrite outbound content or cancel delivery
- `message_sent` — observe outbound delivery success or failure
- **`before_dispatch`** — inspect or rewrite an outbound dispatch before channel handoff
- **`reply_dispatch`** — participate in the final reply-dispatch pipeline

**Sessions and compaction**

- `session_start` / `session_end` — track session lifecycle boundaries
- `before_compaction` / `after_compaction` — observe or annotate compaction cycles
- `before_reset` — observe session-reset events (`/reset`, programmatic resets)

**Subagents**

- `subagent_spawning` / `subagent_delivery_target` / `subagent_spawned` / `subagent_ended` — coordinate subagent routing and completion delivery

**Lifecycle**

- `gateway_start` / `gateway_stop` — start or stop plugin-owned services with the Gateway
- **`before_install`** — inspect skill or plugin install scans and optionally block

## Tool call policy

`before_tool_call` receives:

- `event.toolName`
- `event.params`
- optional `event.runId`
- optional `event.toolCallId`
- context fields such as `ctx.agentId`, `ctx.sessionKey`, `ctx.sessionId`,
  `ctx.runId`, `ctx.jobId` (set on cron-driven runs), and diagnostic `ctx.trace`

It can return:

```typescript
type BeforeToolCallResult = {
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;
  block?: boolean;
  blockReason?: string;
  requireApproval?: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    severity?: "info" | "warning" | "critical";
    timeoutMs?: number;
    timeoutBehavior?: "allow" | "deny";
    pluginId?: string;
    onResolution?: (
      decision: "allow-once" | "allow-always" | "deny" | "timeout" | "cancelled",
    ) => Promise<void> | void;
  };
};
```

Rules:

- `block: true` is terminal and skips lower-priority handlers.
- `block: false` is treated as no decision.
- `params` rewrites the tool parameters for execution.
- `requireApproval` pauses the agent run and asks the user through plugin
  approvals. The `/approve` command can approve both exec and plugin approvals.
- A lower-priority `block: true` can still block after a higher-priority hook
  requested approval.
- `onResolution` receives the resolved approval decision — `allow-once`,
  `allow-always`, `deny`, `timeout`, or `cancelled`.

Bundled plugins that need host-level policy can register trusted tool policies
with `api.registerTrustedToolPolicy(...)`. These run before ordinary
`before_tool_call` hooks and before external plugin decisions. Use them only
for host-trusted gates such as workspace policy, budget enforcement, or
reserved workflow safety. External plugins should use normal `before_tool_call`
hooks.

### Tool result persistence

Tool results can include structured `details` for UI rendering, diagnostics,
media routing, or plugin-owned metadata. Treat `details` as runtime metadata,
not prompt content:

- OpenClaw strips `toolResult.details` before provider replay and compaction
  input so metadata does not become model context.
- Persisted session entries keep only bounded `details`. Oversized details are
  replaced with a compact summary and `persistedDetailsTruncated: true`.
- `tool_result_persist` and `before_message_write` run before the final
  persistence cap. Hooks should still keep returned `details` small and avoid
  placing prompt-relevant text only in `details`; put model-visible tool output
  in `content`.

## Prompt and model hooks

Use the phase-specific hooks for new plugins:

- `before_model_resolve`: receives only the current prompt and attachment
  metadata. Return `providerOverride` or `modelOverride`.
- `agent_turn_prepare`: receives the current prompt, prepared session messages,
  and any exactly-once queued injections drained for this session. Return
  `prependContext` or `appendContext`.
- `before_prompt_build`: receives the current prompt and session messages.
  Return `prependContext`, `appendContext`, `systemPrompt`,
  `prependSystemContext`, or `appendSystemContext`.
- `heartbeat_prompt_contribution`: runs only for heartbeat turns and returns
  `prependContext` or `appendContext`. It is intended for background monitors
  that need to summarize current state without changing user-initiated turns.

`before_agent_start` remains for compatibility. Prefer the explicit hooks above
so your plugin does not depend on a legacy combined phase.

`before_agent_start` and `agent_end` include `event.runId` when OpenClaw can
identify the active run. The same value is also available on `ctx.runId`.
Cron-driven runs also expose `ctx.jobId` (the originating cron job id) so
plugin hooks can scope metrics, side effects, or state to a specific scheduled
job.

Use `model_call_started` and `model_call_ended` for provider-call telemetry
that should not receive raw prompts, history, responses, headers, request
bodies, or provider request IDs. These hooks include stable metadata such as
`runId`, `callId`, `provider`, `model`, optional `api`/`transport`, terminal
`durationMs`/`outcome`, and `upstreamRequestIdHash` when OpenClaw can derive a
bounded provider request-id hash.

`before_agent_finalize` runs only when a harness is about to accept a natural
final assistant answer. It is not the `/stop` cancellation path and does not
run when the user aborts a turn. Return `{ action: "revise", reason }` to ask
the harness for one more model pass before finalization, `{ action:
"finalize", reason? }` to force finalization, or omit a result to continue.
Codex native `Stop` hooks are relayed into this hook as OpenClaw
`before_agent_finalize` decisions.

Non-bundled plugins that need `llm_input`, `llm_output`,
`before_agent_finalize`, or `agent_end` must set:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "my-plugin": {
        "hooks": {
          "allowConversationAccess": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Prompt-mutating hooks and durable next-turn injections can be disabled per plugin
with `plugins.entries.<id>.hooks.allowPromptInjection=false`.

### Session extensions and next-turn injections

Workflow plugins can persist small JSON-compatible session state with
`api.registerSessionExtension(...)` and update it through the Gateway
`sessions.pluginPatch` method. Session rows project registered extension state
through `pluginExtensions`, letting Control UI and other clients render
plugin-owned status without learning plugin internals.

Use `api.enqueueNextTurnInjection(...)` when a plugin needs durable context to
reach the next model turn exactly once. OpenClaw drains queued injections before
prompt hooks, drops expired injections, and deduplicates by `idempotencyKey`
per plugin. This is the right seam for approval resumes, policy summaries,
background monitor deltas, and command continuations that should be visible to
the model on the next turn but should not become permanent system prompt text.

Cleanup semantics are part of the contract. Session extension cleanup and
runtime lifecycle cleanup callbacks receive `reset`, `delete`, `disable`, or
`restart`. The host removes the owning plugin's persistent session extension
state and pending next-turn injections for reset/delete/disable; restart keeps
durable session state while cleanup callbacks let plugins release scheduler
jobs, run context, and other out-of-band resources for the old runtime
generation.

## Message hooks

Use message hooks for channel-level routing and delivery policy:

- `message_received`: observe inbound content, sender, `threadId`, `messageId`,
  `senderId`, optional run/session correlation, and metadata.
- `message_sending`: rewrite `content` or return `{ cancel: true }`.
- `message_sent`: observe final success or failure.

For audio-only TTS replies, `content` may contain the hidden spoken transcript
even when the channel payload has no visible text/caption. Rewriting that
`content` updates the hook-visible transcript only; it is not rendered as a
media caption.

Message hook contexts expose stable correlation fields when available:
`ctx.sessionKey`, `ctx.runId`, `ctx.messageId`, `ctx.senderId`, `ctx.trace`,
`ctx.traceId`, `ctx.spanId`, `ctx.parentSpanId`, and `ctx.callDepth`. Prefer
these first-class fields before reading legacy metadata.

Prefer typed `threadId` and `replyToId` fields before using channel-specific
metadata.

Decision rules:

- `message_sending` with `cancel: true` is terminal.
- `message_sending` with `cancel: false` is treated as no decision.
- Rewritten `content` continues to lower-priority hooks unless a later hook
  cancels delivery.

## Install hooks

`before_install` runs after the built-in scan for skill and plugin installs.
Return additional findings or `{ block: true, blockReason }` to stop the
install.

`block: true` is terminal. `block: false` is treated as no decision.

## Gateway lifecycle

Use `gateway_start` for plugin services that need Gateway-owned state. The
context exposes `ctx.config`, `ctx.workspaceDir`, and `ctx.getCron?.()` for
cron inspection and updates. Use `gateway_stop` to clean up long-running
resources.

Do not rely on the internal `gateway:startup` hook for plugin-owned runtime
services.

## Upcoming deprecations

A few hook-adjacent surfaces are deprecated but still supported. Migrate
before the next major release:

- **Plaintext channel envelopes** in `inbound_claim` and `message_received`
  handlers. Read `BodyForAgent` and the structured user-context blocks
  instead of parsing flat envelope text. See
  [Plaintext channel envelopes → BodyForAgent](/plugins/sdk-migration#active-deprecations).
- **`before_agent_start`** remains for compatibility. New plugins should use
  `before_model_resolve` and `before_prompt_build` instead of the combined
  phase.
- **`onResolution` in `before_tool_call`** now uses the typed
  `PluginApprovalResolution` union (`allow-once` / `allow-always` / `deny` /
  `timeout` / `cancelled`) instead of a free-form `string`.

For the full list — memory capability registration, provider thinking
profile, external auth providers, provider discovery types, task runtime
accessors, and the `command-auth` → `command-status` rename — see
