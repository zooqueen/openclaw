title: "Testing"
---

OpenClaw has three Vitest suites (unit/integration, e2e, live) and a small set
of Docker runners. This doc is a "how we test" guide:

- What each suite covers (and what it deliberately does _not_ cover).
- Which commands to run for common workflows (local, pre-push, debugging).
- How live tests discover credentials and select models/providers.
- How to add regressions for real-world model/provider issues.

## Quick start

Most days:

- Full gate (expected before push): `pnpm build && pnpm check && pnpm check:test-types && pnpm test`
- Faster local full-suite run on a roomy machine: `pnpm test:max`
- Direct Vitest watch loop: `pnpm test:watch`
- Direct file targeting now routes extension/channel paths too: `pnpm test extensions/discord/src/monitor/message-handler.preflight.test.ts`
- Prefer targeted runs first when you are iterating on a single failure.
- Docker-backed QA site: `pnpm qa:lab:up`
- Linux VM-backed QA lane: `pnpm openclaw qa suite --runner multipass --scenario channel-chat-baseline`

When you touch tests or want extra confidence:

- Coverage gate: `pnpm test:coverage`
- E2E suite: `pnpm test:e2e`

When debugging real providers/models (requires real creds):

- Live suite (models + gateway tool/image probes): `pnpm test:live`
- Target one live file quietly: `pnpm test:live -- src/agents/models.profiles.live.test.ts`
- Docker live model sweep: `pnpm test:docker:live-models`
  - Each selected model now runs a text turn plus a small file-read-style probe.
    Models whose metadata advertises `image` input also run a tiny image turn.
    Disable the extra probes with `OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODEL_FILE_PROBE=0` or
    `OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODEL_IMAGE_PROBE=0` when isolating provider failures.
  - CI coverage: daily `OpenClaw Scheduled Live And E2E Checks` and manual
    `OpenClaw Release Checks` both call the reusable live/E2E workflow with
    `include_live_suites: true`, which includes separate Docker live model
    matrix jobs sharded by provider.
  - For focused CI reruns, dispatch `OpenClaw Live And E2E Checks (Reusable)`
    with `include_live_suites: true` and `live_models_only: true`.
  - Add new high-signal provider secrets to `scripts/ci-hydrate-live-auth.sh`
    plus `.github/workflows/openclaw-live-and-e2e-checks-reusable.yml` and its
    scheduled/release callers.
- Native Codex bound-chat smoke: `pnpm test:docker:live-codex-bind`
  - Runs a Docker live lane against the Codex app-server path, binds a synthetic
    Slack DM with `/codex bind`, exercises `/codex fast` and
    `/codex permissions`, then verifies a plain reply and an image attachment
    route through the native plugin binding instead of ACP.
- Moonshot/Kimi cost smoke: with `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` set, run
  `openclaw models list --provider moonshot --json`, then run an isolated
  `openclaw agent --local --session-id live-kimi-cost --message 'Reply exactly: KIMI_LIVE_OK' --thinking off --json`
  against `moonshot/kimi-k2.6`. Verify the JSON reports Moonshot/K2.6 and the
  assistant transcript stores normalized `usage.cost`.

Tip: when you only need one failing case, prefer narrowing live tests via the allowlist env vars described below.

## QA-specific runners

These commands sit beside the main test suites when you need QA-lab realism:

CI runs QA Lab in dedicated workflows. `Parity gate` runs on matching PRs and
from manual dispatch with mock providers. `QA-Lab - All Lanes` runs nightly on
`main` and from manual dispatch with the mock parity gate, live Matrix lane, and
Convex-managed live Telegram lane as parallel jobs. `OpenClaw Release Checks`
runs the same lanes before release approval.

- `pnpm openclaw qa suite`
  - Runs repo-backed QA scenarios directly on the host.
  - Runs multiple selected scenarios in parallel by default with isolated
    gateway workers. `qa-channel` defaults to concurrency 4 (bounded by the
    selected scenario count). Use `--concurrency <count>` to tune the worker
    count, or `--concurrency 1` for the older serial lane.
  - Exits non-zero when any scenario fails. Use `--allow-failures` when you
    want artifacts without a failing exit code.
  - Supports provider modes `live-frontier`, `mock-openai`, and `aimock`.
    `aimock` starts a local AIMock-backed provider server for experimental
    fixture and protocol-mock coverage without replacing the scenario-aware
    `mock-openai` lane.
- `pnpm openclaw qa suite --runner multipass`
  - Runs the same QA suite inside a disposable Multipass Linux VM.
  - Keeps the same scenario-selection behavior as `qa suite` on the host.
  - Reuses the same provider/model selection flags as `qa suite`.
  - Live runs forward the supported QA auth inputs that are practical for the guest:
    env-based provider keys, the QA live provider config path, and `CODEX_HOME`
    when present.
  - Output dirs must stay under the repo root so the guest can write back through
    the mounted workspace.
  - Writes the normal QA report + summary plus Multipass logs under
    `.artifacts/qa-e2e/...`.
- `pnpm qa:lab:up`
  - Starts the Docker-backed QA site for operator-style QA work.
- `pnpm test:docker:npm-onboard-channel-agent`
  - Builds an npm tarball from the current checkout, installs it globally in
    Docker, runs non-interactive OpenAI API-key onboarding, configures Telegram
    by default, verifies enabling the plugin installs runtime dependencies on
    demand, runs doctor, and runs one local agent turn against a mocked OpenAI
    endpoint.
  - Use `OPENCLAW_NPM_ONBOARD_CHANNEL=discord` to run the same packaged-install
    lane with Discord.
- `pnpm test:docker:npm-telegram-live`
  - Installs a published OpenClaw package in Docker, runs installed-package
    onboarding, configures Telegram through the installed CLI, then reuses the
    live Telegram QA lane with that installed package as the SUT Gateway.
  - Defaults to `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_PACKAGE_SPEC=openclaw@beta`.
  - Uses the same Telegram env credentials or Convex credential source as
    `pnpm openclaw qa telegram`. For CI/release automation, set
    `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=convex` plus
    `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` and the role secret. If
    `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` and a Convex role secret are present in CI,
    the Docker wrapper selects Convex automatically.
  - `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_ROLE=ci|maintainer` overrides the shared
    `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_ROLE` for this lane only.
  - GitHub Actions exposes this lane as the manual maintainer workflow
    `NPM Telegram Beta E2E`. It does not run on merge. The workflow uses the
    `qa-live-shared` environment and Convex CI credential leases.
- `pnpm test:docker:bundled-channel-deps`
  - Packs and installs the current OpenClaw build in Docker, starts the Gateway
    with OpenAI configured, then enables bundled channel/plugins via config
    edits.
  - Verifies setup discovery leaves unconfigured plugin runtime dependencies
    absent, the first configured Gateway or doctor run installs each bundled
    plugin's runtime dependencies on demand, and a second restart does not
    reinstall dependencies that were already activated.
  - Also installs a known older npm baseline, enables Telegram before running
    `openclaw update --tag <candidate>`, and verifies the candidate's
    post-update doctor repairs bundled channel runtime dependencies without a
    harness-side postinstall repair.
- `pnpm openclaw qa aimock`
  - Starts only the local AIMock provider server for direct protocol smoke
    testing.
- `pnpm openclaw qa matrix`
  - Runs the Matrix live QA lane against a disposable Docker-backed Tuwunel homeserver.
  - This QA host is repo/dev-only today. Packaged OpenClaw installs do not ship
    `qa-lab`, so they do not expose `openclaw qa`.
  - Repo checkouts load the bundled runner directly; no separate plugin install
    step is needed.
  - Provisions three temporary Matrix users (`driver`, `sut`, `observer`) plus one private room, then starts a QA gateway child with the real Matrix plugin as the SUT transport.
  - Uses the pinned stable Tuwunel image `ghcr.io/matrix-construct/tuwunel:v1.5.1` by default. Override with `OPENCLAW_QA_MATRIX_TUWUNEL_IMAGE` when you need to test a different image.
  - Matrix does not expose shared credential-source flags because the lane provisions disposable users locally.
  - Writes a Matrix QA report, summary, observed-events artifact, and combined stdout/stderr output log under `.artifacts/qa-e2e/...`.
  - Emits progress by default and enforces a hard run timeout with `OPENCLAW_QA_MATRIX_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30 minutes). Cleanup is bounded by `OPENCLAW_QA_MATRIX_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_MS` and failures include the recovery `docker compose ... down --remove-orphans` command.
- `pnpm openclaw qa telegram`
  - Runs the Telegram live QA lane against a real private group using the driver and SUT bot tokens from env.
  - Requires `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`, `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_DRIVER_BOT_TOKEN`, and `OPENCLAW_QA_TELEGRAM_SUT_BOT_TOKEN`. The group id must be the numeric Telegram chat id.
  - Supports `--credential-source convex` for shared pooled credentials. Use env mode by default, or set `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=convex` to opt into pooled leases.
  - Exits non-zero when any scenario fails. Use `--allow-failures` when you
    want artifacts without a failing exit code.
  - Requires two distinct bots in the same private group, with the SUT bot exposing a Telegram username.
  - For stable bot-to-bot observation, enable Bot-to-Bot Communication Mode in `@BotFather` for both bots and ensure the driver bot can observe group bot traffic.
  - Writes a Telegram QA report, summary, and observed-messages artifact under `.artifacts/qa-e2e/...`. Replying scenarios include RTT from driver send request to observed SUT reply.

Live transport lanes share one standard contract so new transports do not drift:

`qa-channel` remains the broad synthetic QA suite and is not part of the live
transport coverage matrix.

| Lane     | Canary | Mention gating | Allowlist block | Top-level reply | Restart resume | Thread follow-up | Thread isolation | Reaction observation | Help command |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Matrix   | x      | x              | x               | x               | x              | x                | x                | x                    |              |
| Telegram | x      |                |                 |                 |                |                  |                  |                      | x            |

### Shared Telegram credentials via Convex (v1)

When `--credential-source convex` (or `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=convex`) is enabled for
`openclaw qa telegram`, QA lab acquires an exclusive lease from a Convex-backed pool, heartbeats
that lease while the lane is running, and releases the lease on shutdown.

Reference Convex project scaffold:

- `qa/convex-credential-broker/`

Required env vars:

- `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` (for example `https://your-deployment.convex.site`)
- One secret for the selected role:
  - `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_MAINTAINER` for `maintainer`
  - `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_CI` for `ci`
- Credential role selection:
  - CLI: `--credential-role maintainer|ci`
  - Env default: `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_ROLE` (defaults to `ci` in CI, `maintainer` otherwise)

Optional env vars:

- `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_LEASE_TTL_MS` (default `1200000`)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (default `30000`)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `90000`)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `15000`)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_ENDPOINT_PREFIX` (default `/qa-credentials/v1`)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_CREDENTIAL_OWNER_ID` (optional trace id)
- `OPENCLAW_QA_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1` allows loopback `http://` Convex URLs for local-only development.

`OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` should use `https://` in normal operation.

Maintainer admin commands (pool add/remove/list) require
`OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_MAINTAINER` specifically.

CLI helpers for maintainers:

```bash
pnpm openclaw qa credentials doctor
pnpm openclaw qa credentials add --kind telegram --payload-file qa/telegram-credential.json
pnpm openclaw qa credentials list --kind telegram
pnpm openclaw qa credentials remove --credential-id <credential-id>
```

Use `doctor` before live runs to check the Convex site URL, broker secrets,
endpoint prefix, HTTP timeout, and admin/list reachability without printing
secret values. Use `--json` for machine-readable output in scripts and CI
utilities.

Default endpoint contract (`OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` + `/qa-credentials/v1`):

- `POST /acquire`
  - Request: `{ kind, ownerId, actorRole, leaseTtlMs, heartbeatIntervalMs }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok", credentialId, leaseToken, payload, leaseTtlMs?, heartbeatIntervalMs? }`
  - Exhausted/retryable: `{ status: "error", code: "POOL_EXHAUSTED" | "NO_CREDENTIAL_AVAILABLE", ... }`
- `POST /heartbeat`
  - Request: `{ kind, ownerId, actorRole, credentialId, leaseToken, leaseTtlMs }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok" }` (or empty `2xx`)
- `POST /release`
  - Request: `{ kind, ownerId, actorRole, credentialId, leaseToken }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok" }` (or empty `2xx`)
- `POST /admin/add` (maintainer secret only)
  - Request: `{ kind, actorId, payload, note?, status? }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok", credential }`
- `POST /admin/remove` (maintainer secret only)
  - Request: `{ credentialId, actorId }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok", changed, credential }`
  - Active lease guard: `{ status: "error", code: "LEASE_ACTIVE", ... }`
- `POST /admin/list` (maintainer secret only)
  - Request: `{ kind?, status?, includePayload?, limit? }`
  - Success: `{ status: "ok", credentials, count }`

Payload shape for Telegram kind:

- `{ groupId: string, driverToken: string, sutToken: string }`
- `groupId` must be a numeric Telegram chat id string.
- `admin/add` validates this shape for `kind: "telegram"` and rejects malformed payloads.

### Adding a channel to QA

Adding a channel to the markdown QA system requires exactly two things:

1. A transport adapter for the channel.
2. A scenario pack that exercises the channel contract.

Do not add a new top-level QA command root when the shared `qa-lab` host can
own the flow.

`qa-lab` owns the shared host mechanics:

- the `openclaw qa` command root
- suite startup and teardown
- worker concurrency
- artifact writing
- report generation
- scenario execution
- compatibility aliases for older `qa-channel` scenarios

Runner plugins own the transport contract:

- how `openclaw qa <runner>` is mounted beneath the shared `qa` root
- how the gateway is configured for that transport
- how readiness is checked
- how inbound events are injected
- how outbound messages are observed
- how transcripts and normalized transport state are exposed
- how transport-backed actions are executed
- how transport-specific reset or cleanup is handled

The minimum adoption bar for a new channel is:

1. Keep `qa-lab` as the owner of the shared `qa` root.
2. Implement the transport runner on the shared `qa-lab` host seam.
3. Keep transport-specific mechanics inside the runner plugin or channel harness.
4. Mount the runner as `openclaw qa <runner>` instead of registering a competing root command.
   Runner plugins should declare `qaRunners` in `openclaw.plugin.json` and export a matching `qaRunnerCliRegistrations` array from `runtime-api.ts`.
   Keep `runtime-api.ts` light; lazy CLI and runner execution should stay behind separate entrypoints.
5. Author or adapt markdown scenarios under the themed `qa/scenarios/` directories.
6. Use the generic scenario helpers for new scenarios.
7. Keep existing compatibility aliases working unless the repo is doing an intentional migration.

The decision rule is strict:

- If behavior can be expressed once in `qa-lab`, put it in `qa-lab`.
- If behavior depends on one channel transport, keep it in that runner plugin or plugin harness.
- If a scenario needs a new capability that more than one channel can use, add a generic helper instead of a channel-specific branch in `suite.ts`.
- If a behavior is only meaningful for one transport, keep the scenario transport-specific and make that explicit in the scenario contract.

Preferred generic helper names for new scenarios are:

- `waitForTransportReady`
- `waitForChannelReady`
- `injectInboundMessage`
- `injectOutboundMessage`
- `waitForTransportOutboundMessage`
- `waitForChannelOutboundMessage`
- `waitForNoTransportOutbound`
- `getTransportSnapshot`
- `readTransportMessage`
- `readTransportTranscript`
- `formatTransportTranscript`
- `resetTransport`

Compatibility aliases remain available for existing scenarios, including:

- `waitForQaChannelReady`
- `waitForOutboundMessage`
- `waitForNoOutbound`
- `formatConversationTranscript`
- `resetBus`

New channel work should use the generic helper names.
Compatibility aliases exist to avoid a flag day migration, not as the model for
new scenario authoring.

## Test suites (what runs where)

Think of the suites as “increasing realism” (and increasing flakiness/cost):

### Unit / integration (default)

- Command: `pnpm test`
- Config: untargeted runs use the `vitest.full-*.config.ts` shard set and may expand multi-project shards into per-project configs for parallel scheduling
- Files: core/unit inventories under `src/**/*.test.ts`, `packages/**/*.test.ts`, `test/**/*.test.ts`, and the whitelisted `ui` node tests covered by `vitest.unit.config.ts`
- Scope:
  - Pure unit tests
  - In-process integration tests (gateway auth, routing, tooling, parsing, config)
  - Deterministic regressions for known bugs
- Expectations:
  - Runs in CI
  - No real keys required
  - Should be fast and stable

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Projects, shards, and scoped lanes">

    - Untargeted `pnpm test` runs twelve smaller shard configs (`core-unit-fast`, `core-unit-src`, `core-unit-security`, `core-unit-ui`, `core-unit-support`, `core-support-boundary`, `core-contracts`, `core-bundled`, `core-runtime`, `agentic`, `auto-reply`, `extensions`) instead of one giant native root-project process. This cuts peak RSS on loaded machines and avoids auto-reply/extension work starving unrelated suites.
    - `pnpm test --watch` still uses the native root `vitest.config.ts` project graph, because a multi-shard watch loop is not practical.
    - `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:watch`, and `pnpm test:perf:imports` route explicit file/directory targets through scoped lanes first, so `pnpm test extensions/discord/src/monitor/message-handler.preflight.test.ts` avoids paying the full root project startup tax.
    - `pnpm test:changed` expands changed git paths into the same scoped lanes when the diff only touches routable source/test files; config/setup edits still fall back to the broad root-project rerun.
    - `pnpm check:changed` is the normal smart local gate for narrow work. It classifies the diff into core, core tests, extensions, extension tests, apps, docs, release metadata, and tooling, then runs the matching typecheck/lint/test lanes. Public Plugin SDK and plugin-contract changes include one extension validation pass because extensions depend on those core contracts. Release metadata-only version bumps run targeted version/config/root-dependency checks instead of the full suite, with a guard that rejects package changes outside the top-level version field.
    - Import-light unit tests from agents, commands, plugins, auto-reply helpers, `plugin-sdk`, and similar pure utility areas route through the `unit-fast` lane, which skips `test/setup-openclaw-runtime.ts`; stateful/runtime-heavy files stay on the existing lanes.
    - Selected `plugin-sdk` and `commands` helper source files also map changed-mode runs to explicit sibling tests in those light lanes, so helper edits avoid rerunning the full heavy suite for that directory.
    - `auto-reply` has three dedicated buckets: top-level core helpers, top-level `reply.*` integration tests, and the `src/auto-reply/reply/**` subtree. This keeps the heaviest reply harness work off the cheap status/chunk/token tests.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Embedded runner coverage">

    - When you change message-tool discovery inputs or compaction runtime
      context, keep both levels of coverage.
    - Add focused helper regressions for pure routing and normalization
      boundaries.
    - Keep the embedded runner integration suites healthy:
      `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/compact.hooks.test.ts`,
      `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.overflow-compaction.test.ts`, and
      `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.overflow-compaction.loop.test.ts`.
    - Those suites verify that scoped ids and compaction behavior still flow
      through the real `run.ts` / `compact.ts` paths; helper-only tests are
      not a sufficient substitute for those integration paths.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vitest pool and isolation defaults">

    - Base Vitest config defaults to `threads`.
    - The shared Vitest config fixes `isolate: false` and uses the
      non-isolated runner across the root projects, e2e, and live configs.
    - The root UI lane keeps its `jsdom` setup and optimizer, but runs on the
      shared non-isolated runner too.
    - Each `pnpm test` shard inherits the same `threads` + `isolate: false`
      defaults from the shared Vitest config.
    - `scripts/run-vitest.mjs` adds `--no-maglev` for Vitest child Node
      processes by default to reduce V8 compile churn during big local runs.
      Set `OPENCLAW_VITEST_ENABLE_MAGLEV=1` to compare against stock V8
      behavior.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fast local iteration">

    - `pnpm changed:lanes` shows which architectural lanes a diff triggers.
    - The pre-commit hook is formatting-only. It restages formatted files and
      does not run lint, typecheck, or tests.
    - Run `pnpm check:changed` explicitly before handoff or push when you
      need the smart local gate. Public Plugin SDK and plugin-contract
      changes include one extension validation pass.
    - `pnpm test:changed` routes through scoped lanes when the changed paths
      map cleanly to a smaller suite.
    - `pnpm test:max` and `pnpm test:changed:max` keep the same routing
      behavior, just with a higher worker cap.
    - Local worker auto-scaling is intentionally conservative and backs off
      when the host load average is already high, so multiple concurrent
      Vitest runs do less damage by default.
    - The base Vitest config marks the projects/config files as
      `forceRerunTriggers` so changed-mode reruns stay correct when test
      wiring changes.
    - The config keeps `OPENCLAW_VITEST_FS_MODULE_CACHE` enabled on supported
      hosts; set `OPENCLAW_VITEST_FS_MODULE_CACHE_PATH=/abs/path` if you want
      one explicit cache location for direct profiling.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Perf debugging">

    - `pnpm test:perf:imports` enables Vitest import-duration reporting plus
      import-breakdown output.
    - `pnpm test:perf:imports:changed` scopes the same profiling view to
      files changed since `origin/main`.
    - When one hot test still spends most of its time in startup imports,
      keep heavy dependencies behind a narrow local `*.runtime.ts` seam and
      mock that seam directly instead of deep-importing runtime helpers just
      to pass them through `vi.mock(...)`.
    - `pnpm test:perf:changed:bench -- --ref <git-ref>` compares routed
      `test:changed` against the native root-project path for that committed
      diff and prints wall time plus macOS max RSS.
    - `pnpm test:perf:changed:bench -- --worktree` benchmarks the current
      dirty tree by routing the changed file list through
      `scripts/test-projects.mjs` and the root Vitest config.
    - `pnpm test:perf:profile:main` writes a main-thread CPU profile for
      Vitest/Vite startup and transform overhead.
    - `pnpm test:perf:profile:runner` writes runner CPU+heap profiles for the
      unit suite with file parallelism disabled.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Stability (gateway)

- Command: `pnpm test:stability:gateway`
- Config: `vitest.gateway.config.ts`, forced to one worker
- Scope:
  - Starts a real loopback Gateway with diagnostics enabled by default
  - Drives synthetic gateway message, memory, and large-payload churn through the diagnostic event path
  - Queries `diagnostics.stability` over the Gateway WS RPC
  - Covers diagnostic stability bundle persistence helpers
  - Asserts the recorder remains bounded, synthetic RSS samples stay under the pressure budget, and per-session queue depths drain back to zero
- Expectations:
  - CI-safe and keyless
  - Narrow lane for stability-regression follow-up, not a substitute for the full Gateway suite

### E2E (gateway smoke)

- Command: `pnpm test:e2e`
- Config: `vitest.e2e.config.ts`
- Files: `src/**/*.e2e.test.ts`, `test/**/*.e2e.test.ts`, and bundled-plugin E2E tests under `extensions/`
- Runtime defaults:
  - Uses Vitest `threads` with `isolate: false`, matching the rest of the repo.
  - Uses adaptive workers (CI: up to 2, local: 1 by default).
  - Runs in silent mode by default to reduce console I/O overhead.
- Useful overrides:
  - `OPENCLAW_E2E_WORKERS=<n>` to force worker count (capped at 16).
  - `OPENCLAW_E2E_VERBOSE=1` to re-enable verbose console output.
- Scope:
  - Multi-instance gateway end-to-end behavior
  - WebSocket/HTTP surfaces, node pairing, and heavier networking
- Expectations:
  - Runs in CI (when enabled in the pipeline)
  - No real keys required
  - More moving parts than unit tests (can be slower)

### E2E: OpenShell backend smoke

- Command: `pnpm test:e2e:openshell`
- File: `extensions/openshell/src/backend.e2e.test.ts`
- Scope:
  - Starts an isolated OpenShell gateway on the host via Docker
  - Creates a sandbox from a temporary local Dockerfile
  - Exercises OpenClaw's OpenShell backend over real `sandbox ssh-config` + SSH exec
  - Verifies remote-canonical filesystem behavior through the sandbox fs bridge
- Expectations:
  - Opt-in only; not part of the default `pnpm test:e2e` run
  - Requires a local `openshell` CLI plus a working Docker daemon
  - Uses isolated `HOME` / `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, then destroys the test gateway and sandbox
- Useful overrides:
  - `OPENCLAW_E2E_OPENSHELL=1` to enable the test when running the broader e2e suite manually
  - `OPENCLAW_E2E_OPENSHELL_COMMAND=/path/to/openshell` to point at a non-default CLI binary or wrapper script

### Live (real providers + real models)

- Command: `pnpm test:live`
- Config: `vitest.live.config.ts`
- Files: `src/**/*.live.test.ts`, `test/**/*.live.test.ts`, and bundled-plugin live tests under `extensions/`
- Default: **enabled** by `pnpm test:live` (sets `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1`)
- Scope:
  - “Does this provider/model actually work _today_ with real creds?”
  - Catch provider format changes, tool-calling quirks, auth issues, and rate limit behavior
- Expectations:
  - Not CI-stable by design (real networks, real provider policies, quotas, outages)
  - Costs money / uses rate limits
  - Prefer running narrowed subsets instead of “everything”
- Live runs source `~/.profile` to pick up missing API keys.
- By default, live runs still isolate `HOME` and copy config/auth material into a temp test home so unit fixtures cannot mutate your real `~/.openclaw`.
- Set `OPENCLAW_LIVE_USE_REAL_HOME=1` only when you intentionally need live tests to use your real home directory.
- `pnpm test:live` now defaults to a quieter mode: it keeps `[live] ...` progress output, but suppresses the extra `~/.profile` notice and mutes gateway bootstrap logs/Bonjour chatter. Set `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=0` if you want the full startup logs back.
- API key rotation (provider-specific): set `*_API_KEYS` with comma/semicolon format or `*_API_KEY_1`, `*_API_KEY_2` (for example `OPENAI_API_KEYS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEYS`, `GEMINI_API_KEYS`) or per-live override via `OPENCLAW_LIVE_*_KEY`; tests retry on rate limit responses.
- Progress/heartbeat output:
  - Live suites now emit progress lines to stderr so long provider calls are visibly active even when Vitest console capture is quiet.
  - `vitest.live.config.ts` disables Vitest console interception so provider/gateway progress lines stream immediately during live runs.
  - Tune direct-model heartbeats with `OPENCLAW_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_MS`.
  - Tune gateway/probe heartbeats with `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_HEARTBEAT_MS`.

## Which suite should I run?

Use this decision table:

- Editing logic/tests: run `pnpm test` (and `pnpm test:coverage` if you changed a lot)
- Touching gateway networking / WS protocol / pairing: add `pnpm test:e2e`
- Debugging “my bot is down” / provider-specific failures / tool calling: run a narrowed `pnpm test:live`

## Live (network-touching) tests

For the live model matrix, CLI backend smokes, ACP smokes, Codex app-server
harness, and all media-provider live tests (Deepgram, BytePlus, ComfyUI, image,
music, video, media harness) — plus credential handling for live runs — see
[Testing — live suites](/help/testing-live).

## Docker runners (optional "works in Linux" checks)

These Docker runners split into two buckets:

- Live-model runners: `test:docker:live-models` and `test:docker:live-gateway` run only their matching profile-key live file inside the repo Docker image (`src/agents/models.profiles.live.test.ts` and `src/gateway/gateway-models.profiles.live.test.ts`), mounting your local config dir and workspace (and sourcing `~/.profile` if mounted). The matching local entrypoints are `test:live:models-profiles` and `test:live:gateway-profiles`.
- Docker live runners default to a smaller smoke cap so a full Docker sweep stays practical:
  `test:docker:live-models` defaults to `OPENCLAW_LIVE_MAX_MODELS=12`, and
  `test:docker:live-gateway` defaults to `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_SMOKE=1`,
  `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MAX_MODELS=8`,
  `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS=45000`, and
  `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS=90000`. Override those env vars when you
  explicitly want the larger exhaustive scan.
- `test:docker:all` builds the live Docker image once via `test:docker:live-build`, then reuses it for the live Docker lanes. It also builds one shared `scripts/e2e/Dockerfile` image via `test:docker:e2e-build` and reuses it for the E2E container smoke runners that exercise the built app. The aggregate uses a weighted local scheduler: `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_PARALLELISM` controls process slots, while resource caps keep heavy live, npm-install, and multi-service lanes from all starting at once. Defaults are 10 slots, `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_LIVE_LIMIT=4`, `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_NPM_LIMIT=4`, and `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_SERVICE_LIMIT=5`; tune `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_WEIGHT_LIMIT` or `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_DOCKER_LIMIT` only when the Docker host has more headroom.
- Container smoke runners: `test:docker:openwebui`, `test:docker:onboard`, `test:docker:npm-onboard-channel-agent`, `test:docker:gateway-network`, `test:docker:mcp-channels`, `test:docker:pi-bundle-mcp-tools`, `test:docker:cron-mcp-cleanup`, `test:docker:plugins`, `test:docker:plugin-update`, and `test:docker:config-reload` boot one or more real containers and verify higher-level integration paths.

The live-model Docker runners also bind-mount only the needed CLI auth homes (or all supported ones when the run is not narrowed), then copy them into the container home before the run so external-CLI OAuth can refresh tokens without mutating the host auth store:

- Direct models: `pnpm test:docker:live-models` (script: `scripts/test-live-models-docker.sh`)
- ACP bind smoke: `pnpm test:docker:live-acp-bind` (script: `scripts/test-live-acp-bind-docker.sh`)
- CLI backend smoke: `pnpm test:docker:live-cli-backend` (script: `scripts/test-live-cli-backend-docker.sh`)
- Codex app-server harness smoke: `pnpm test:docker:live-codex-harness` (script: `scripts/test-live-codex-harness-docker.sh`)
- Gateway + dev agent: `pnpm test:docker:live-gateway` (script: `scripts/test-live-gateway-models-docker.sh`)
- Open WebUI live smoke: `pnpm test:docker:openwebui` (script: `scripts/e2e/openwebui-docker.sh`)
- Onboarding wizard (TTY, full scaffolding): `pnpm test:docker:onboard` (script: `scripts/e2e/onboard-docker.sh`)
- Npm tarball onboarding/channel/agent smoke: `pnpm test:docker:npm-onboard-channel-agent` installs the packed OpenClaw tarball globally in Docker, configures OpenAI via env-ref onboarding plus Telegram by default, verifies doctor repairs activated plugin runtime deps, and runs one mocked OpenAI agent turn. Reuse a prebuilt tarball with `OPENCLAW_NPM_ONBOARD_PACKAGE_TGZ=/path/to/openclaw-*.tgz`, skip the host rebuild with `OPENCLAW_NPM_ONBOARD_HOST_BUILD=0`, or switch channel with `OPENCLAW_NPM_ONBOARD_CHANNEL=discord`.
- Bun global install smoke: `bash scripts/e2e/bun-global-install-smoke.sh` packs the current tree, installs it with `bun install -g` in an isolated home, and verifies `openclaw infer image providers --json` returns bundled image providers instead of hanging. Reuse a prebuilt tarball with `OPENCLAW_BUN_GLOBAL_SMOKE_PACKAGE_TGZ=/path/to/openclaw-*.tgz`, skip the host build with `OPENCLAW_BUN_GLOBAL_SMOKE_HOST_BUILD=0`, or copy `dist/` from a built Docker image with `OPENCLAW_BUN_GLOBAL_SMOKE_DIST_IMAGE=openclaw-dockerfile-smoke:local`.
- Installer Docker smoke: `bash scripts/test-install-sh-docker.sh` shares one npm cache across its root, update, and direct-npm containers. Update smoke defaults to npm `latest` as the stable baseline before upgrading to the candidate tarball. Non-root installer checks keep an isolated npm cache so root-owned cache entries do not mask user-local install behavior. Set `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_NPM_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache` to reuse the root/update/direct-npm cache across local reruns.
- Install Smoke CI skips the duplicate direct-npm global update with `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_SMOKE_SKIP_NPM_GLOBAL=1`; run the script locally without that env when direct `npm install -g` coverage is needed.
- Gateway networking (two containers, WS auth + health): `pnpm test:docker:gateway-network` (script: `scripts/e2e/gateway-network-docker.sh`)
- OpenAI Responses web_search minimal reasoning regression: `pnpm test:docker:openai-web-search-minimal` (script: `scripts/e2e/openai-web-search-minimal-docker.sh`) runs a mocked OpenAI server through Gateway, verifies `web_search` raises `reasoning.effort` from `minimal` to `low`, then forces the provider schema reject and checks the raw detail appears in Gateway logs.
- MCP channel bridge (seeded Gateway + stdio bridge + raw Claude notification-frame smoke): `pnpm test:docker:mcp-channels` (script: `scripts/e2e/mcp-channels-docker.sh`)
- Pi bundle MCP tools (real stdio MCP server + embedded Pi profile allow/deny smoke): `pnpm test:docker:pi-bundle-mcp-tools` (script: `scripts/e2e/pi-bundle-mcp-tools-docker.sh`)
- Cron/subagent MCP cleanup (real Gateway + stdio MCP child teardown after isolated cron and one-shot subagent runs): `pnpm test:docker:cron-mcp-cleanup` (script: `scripts/e2e/cron-mcp-cleanup-docker.sh`)
- Plugins (install smoke + `/plugin` alias + Claude-bundle restart semantics): `pnpm test:docker:plugins` (script: `scripts/e2e/plugins-docker.sh`)
- Plugin update unchanged smoke: `pnpm test:docker:plugin-update` (script: `scripts/e2e/plugin-update-unchanged-docker.sh`)
- Config reload metadata smoke: `pnpm test:docker:config-reload` (script: `scripts/e2e/config-reload-source-docker.sh`)
- Bundled plugin runtime deps: `pnpm test:docker:bundled-channel-deps` builds a small Docker runner image by default, builds and packs OpenClaw once on the host, then mounts that tarball into each Linux install scenario. Reuse the image with `OPENCLAW_SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD=1`, skip the host rebuild after a fresh local build with `OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_HOST_BUILD=0`, or point at an existing tarball with `OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_PACKAGE_TGZ=/path/to/openclaw-*.tgz`. The full Docker aggregate pre-packs this tarball once, then shards bundled channel checks into independent lanes; use `OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNELS=telegram,slack` to narrow the channel matrix when running the bundled lane directly. The lane also verifies that `channels.<id>.enabled=false` and `plugins.entries.<id>.enabled=false` suppress doctor/runtime-dependency repair.
- Narrow bundled plugin runtime deps while iterating by disabling unrelated scenarios, for example:
  `OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_SCENARIOS=0 OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_UPDATE_SCENARIO=0 OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_ROOT_OWNED_SCENARIO=0 OPENCLAW_BUNDLED_CHANNEL_SETUP_ENTRY_SCENARIO=0 pnpm test:docker:bundled-channel-deps`.

To prebuild and reuse the shared built-app image manually:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DOCKER_E2E_IMAGE=openclaw-docker-e2e:local pnpm test:docker:e2e-build
OPENCLAW_DOCKER_E2E_IMAGE=openclaw-docker-e2e:local OPENCLAW_SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD=1 pnpm test:docker:mcp-channels
```

Suite-specific image overrides such as `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_NETWORK_E2E_IMAGE` still win when set. When `OPENCLAW_SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD=1` points at a remote shared image, the scripts pull it if it is not already local. The QR and installer Docker tests keep their own Dockerfiles because they validate package/install behavior rather than the shared built-app runtime.

The live-model Docker runners also bind-mount the current checkout read-only and
stage it into a temporary workdir inside the container. This keeps the runtime
image slim while still running Vitest against your exact local source/config.
The staging step skips large local-only caches and app build outputs such as
`.pnpm-store`, `.worktrees`, `__openclaw_vitest__`, and app-local `.build` or
Gradle output directories so Docker live runs do not spend minutes copying
machine-specific artifacts.
They also set `OPENCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1` so gateway live probes do not start
real Telegram/Discord/etc. channel workers inside the container.
`test:docker:live-models` still runs `pnpm test:live`, so pass through
`OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_*` as well when you need to narrow or exclude gateway
live coverage from that Docker lane.
`test:docker:openwebui` is a higher-level compatibility smoke: it starts an
OpenClaw gateway container with the OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoints enabled,
starts a pinned Open WebUI container against that gateway, signs in through
Open WebUI, verifies `/api/models` exposes `openclaw/default`, then sends a
real chat request through Open WebUI's `/api/chat/completions` proxy.
The first run can be noticeably slower because Docker may need to pull the
Open WebUI image and Open WebUI may need to finish its own cold-start setup.
This lane expects a usable live model key, and `OPENCLAW_PROFILE_FILE`
(`~/.profile` by default) is the primary way to provide it in Dockerized runs.
Successful runs print a small JSON payload like `{ "ok": true, "model":
"openclaw/default", ... }`.
`test:docker:mcp-channels` is intentionally deterministic and does not need a
real Telegram, Discord, or iMessage account. It boots a seeded Gateway
container, starts a second container that spawns `openclaw mcp serve`, then
verifies routed conversation discovery, transcript reads, attachment metadata,
live event queue behavior, outbound send routing, and Claude-style channel +
permission notifications over the real stdio MCP bridge. The notification check
inspects the raw stdio MCP frames directly so the smoke validates what the
bridge actually emits, not just what a specific client SDK happens to surface.
`test:docker:pi-bundle-mcp-tools` is deterministic and does not need a live
model key. It builds the repo Docker image, starts a real stdio MCP probe server
inside the container, materializes that server through the embedded Pi bundle
MCP runtime, executes the tool, then verifies `coding` and `messaging` keep
`bundle-mcp` tools while `minimal` and `tools.deny: ["bundle-mcp"]` filter them.
`test:docker:cron-mcp-cleanup` is deterministic and does not need a live model
key. It starts a seeded Gateway with a real stdio MCP probe server, runs an
isolated cron turn and a `/subagents spawn` one-shot child turn, then verifies
the MCP child process exits after each run.

Manual ACP plain-language thread smoke (not CI):

- `bun scripts/dev/discord-acp-plain-language-smoke.ts --channel <discord-channel-id> ...`
- Keep this script for regression/debug workflows. It may be needed again for ACP thread routing validation, so do not delete it.

Useful env vars:

- `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR=...` (default: `~/.openclaw`) mounted to `/home/node/.openclaw`
- `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=...` (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace`) mounted to `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace`
- `OPENCLAW_PROFILE_FILE=...` (default: `~/.profile`) mounted to `/home/node/.profile` and sourced before running tests
- `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_PROFILE_ENV_ONLY=1` to verify only env vars sourced from `OPENCLAW_PROFILE_FILE`, using temporary config/workspace dirs and no external CLI auth mounts
- `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_CLI_TOOLS_DIR=...` (default: `~/.cache/openclaw/docker-cli-tools`) mounted to `/home/node/.npm-global` for cached CLI installs inside Docker
- External CLI auth dirs/files under `$HOME` are mounted read-only under `/host-auth...`, then copied into `/home/node/...` before tests start
  - Default dirs: `.minimax`
  - Default files: `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `.claude.json`, `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
  - Narrowed provider runs mount only the needed dirs/files inferred from `OPENCLAW_LIVE_PROVIDERS` / `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_PROVIDERS`
  - Override manually with `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_AUTH_DIRS=all`, `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_AUTH_DIRS=none`, or a comma list like `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_AUTH_DIRS=.claude,.codex`
- `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_MODELS=...` / `OPENCLAW_LIVE_MODELS=...` to narrow the run
- `OPENCLAW_LIVE_GATEWAY_PROVIDERS=...` / `OPENCLAW_LIVE_PROVIDERS=...` to filter providers in-container
- `OPENCLAW_SKIP_DOCKER_BUILD=1` to reuse an existing `openclaw:local-live` image for reruns that do not need a rebuild
- `OPENCLAW_LIVE_REQUIRE_PROFILE_KEYS=1` to ensure creds come from the profile store (not env)
- `OPENCLAW_OPENWEBUI_MODEL=...` to choose the model exposed by the gateway for the Open WebUI smoke
- `OPENCLAW_OPENWEBUI_PROMPT=...` to override the nonce-check prompt used by the Open WebUI smoke
- `OPENWEBUI_IMAGE=...` to override the pinned Open WebUI image tag

## Docs sanity

Run docs checks after doc edits: `pnpm check:docs`.
Run full Mintlify anchor validation when you need in-page heading checks too: `pnpm docs:check-links:anchors`.

## Offline regression (CI-safe)

These are “real pipeline” regressions without real providers:

- Gateway tool calling (mock OpenAI, real gateway + agent loop): `src/gateway/gateway.test.ts` (case: "runs a mock OpenAI tool call end-to-end via gateway agent loop")
- Gateway wizard (WS `wizard.start`/`wizard.next`, writes config + auth enforced): `src/gateway/gateway.test.ts` (case: "runs wizard over ws and writes auth token config")

## Agent reliability evals (skills)

We already have a few CI-safe tests that behave like “agent reliability evals”:

- Mock tool-calling through the real gateway + agent loop (`src/gateway/gateway.test.ts`).
- End-to-end wizard flows that validate session wiring and config effects (`src/gateway/gateway.test.ts`).

What’s still missing for skills (see [Skills](/tools/skills)):

- **Decisioning:** when skills are listed in the prompt, does the agent pick the right skill (or avoid irrelevant ones)?
- **Compliance:** does the agent read `SKILL.md` before use and follow required steps/args?
- **Workflow contracts:** multi-turn scenarios that assert tool order, session history carryover, and sandbox boundaries.

Future evals should stay deterministic first:

- A scenario runner using mock providers to assert tool calls + order, skill file reads, and session wiring.
- A small suite of skill-focused scenarios (use vs avoid, gating, prompt injection).
- Optional live evals (opt-in, env-gated) only after the CI-safe suite is in place.

## Contract tests (plugin and channel shape)

Contract tests verify that every registered plugin and channel conforms to its
interface contract. They iterate over all discovered plugins and run a suite of
shape and behavior assertions. The default `pnpm test` unit lane intentionally
skips these shared seam and smoke files; run the contract commands explicitly
when you touch shared channel or provider surfaces.

### Commands

- All contracts: `pnpm test:contracts`
- Channel contracts only: `pnpm test:contracts:channels`
- Provider contracts only: `pnpm test:contracts:plugins`

### Channel contracts

Located in `src/channels/plugins/contracts/*.contract.test.ts`:

- **plugin** - Basic plugin shape (id, name, capabilities)
- **setup** - Setup wizard contract
- **session-binding** - Session binding behavior
- **outbound-payload** - Message payload structure
- **inbound** - Inbound message handling
- **actions** - Channel action handlers
- **threading** - Thread ID handling
- **directory** - Directory/roster API
- **group-policy** - Group policy enforcement

### Provider status contracts

Located in `src/plugins/contracts/*.contract.test.ts`.

- **status** - Channel status probes
- **registry** - Plugin registry shape

### Provider contracts

Located in `src/plugins/contracts/*.contract.test.ts`:

- **auth** - Auth flow contract
- **auth-choice** - Auth choice/selection
- **catalog** - Model catalog API
- **discovery** - Plugin discovery
- **loader** - Plugin loading
- **runtime** - Provider runtime
- **shape** - Plugin shape/interface
- **wizard** - Setup wizard

### When to run

- After changing plugin-sdk exports or subpaths
- After adding or modifying a channel or provider plugin
- After refactoring plugin registration or discovery

Contract tests run in CI and do not require real API keys.

## Adding regressions (guidance)

When you fix a provider/model issue discovered in live:

- Add a CI-safe regression if possible (mock/stub provider, or capture the exact request-shape transformation)
- If it’s inherently live-only (rate limits, auth policies), keep the live test narrow and opt-in via env vars
- Prefer targeting the smallest layer that catches the bug:
  - provider request conversion/replay bug → direct models test
  - gateway session/history/tool pipeline bug → gateway live smoke or CI-safe gateway mock test
- SecretRef traversal guardrail:
  - `src/secrets/exec-secret-ref-id-parity.test.ts` derives one sampled target per SecretRef class from registry metadata (`listSecretTargetRegistryEntries()`), then asserts traversal-segment exec ids are rejected.
  - If you add a new `includeInPlan` SecretRef target family in `src/secrets/target-registry-data.ts`, update `classifyTargetClass` in that test. The test intentionally fails on unclassified target ids so new classes cannot be skipped silently.
