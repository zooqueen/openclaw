# Local Embedding Safety Plan

Issue: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/44202

## Context

OpenClaw users on Apple Silicon have reported local memory embedding crashes in
the `node-llama-cpp` and `ggml-metal` path. The observed crash can happen during
Metal cleanup on process exit, after embedding work has already completed.

This is separate from the generic plugin embedding provider contract added by
PR #84947. The generic contract is useful future plumbing, but the immediate
safety work should stay on the existing local memory embedding path.

## Goal

Make local GGUF embeddings safer on macOS Apple Silicon without waiting for the
new plugin SDK embedding provider bridge.

The headline deliverable is a worker boundary: a native local embedding failure
must degrade memory search instead of threatening the Gateway process. Supporting
deliverables should reduce native runtime stress, give operators an explicit CPU
or Metal policy for local embeddings, and make degraded memory state visible.

## Non-Goals

- Do not redesign the public plugin embedding provider contract.
- Do not require migrating memory to generic `embeddingProviders` in this fix.
- Do not add a new production embedding provider.
- Do not make local embedding failures silently fall back to cloud providers.
- Do not remove existing `memoryEmbeddingProviders` compatibility.
- Do not treat QMD and the in-process local provider as the same runtime shape:
  QMD is already a subprocess and needs policy/status/backoff integration, while
  the OpenClaw local provider needs a new worker boundary.

## Current Problem Shape

- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.ts` lazy-loads
  `node-llama-cpp` inside the Gateway process.
- The local provider currently calls `getLlama({ logLevel })` with no explicit
  CPU or Metal policy.
- Local `embedBatch` currently runs `ctx.getEmbeddingFor(...)` calls through
  `Promise.all`, which can exercise native embedding work concurrently.
- The strict config schema accepts only `local.modelPath`,
  `local.modelCacheDir`, and `local.contextSize`.
- If the native addon aborts the process, TypeScript error handling cannot catch
  it inside the same process.

## Proposed Work

Ship this as one bounded safety fix, not as separate delivery phases. The items
below are the internal implementation checklist for that fix. The optional
plugin-contract bridge can drop to a follow-up if it makes the safety PR bigger
or slower.

### Serialize Local Batch Embeddings

Make local `embedBatch` sequential by default in the existing local provider.
This is a mitigation, not the crash fix: it reduces concurrent pressure on
`node-llama-cpp`, but a native abort can still kill the Gateway until worker
isolation lands.

Files:

- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.ts`
- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.test.ts`

Acceptance:

- A focused test proves the second local embedding request does not start until
  the first has resolved.
- Abort signals are still checked before each item.
- Existing query and close behavior remains unchanged.

### Add Explicit CPU Or Metal Policy

Add a local embedding runtime policy under `memorySearch.local`.

Candidate config:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      memorySearch: {
        local: {
          gpu: "auto" // "auto" | "metal" | "cpu"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Implementation notes:

- Map `"auto"` to `getLlama({ gpu: "auto" })`.
- Map `"metal"` to `getLlama({ gpu: "metal" })`.
- Map `"cpu"` to `getLlama({ gpu: false })`.
- Consider `loadModel({ gpuLayers: 0 })` for CPU-only mode if upstream
  `node-llama-cpp` behavior requires it.
- Preserve current behavior by defaulting to `"auto"` unless maintainers
  explicitly choose a safety-first Apple Silicon default. Document `"cpu"` as the
  safer Apple Silicon mitigation and call out the performance tradeoff.

Files:

- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/node-llama.ts`
- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.types.ts`
- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.ts`
- `src/types/node-llama-cpp.d.ts`
- `src/config/zod-schema.agent-runtime.ts`
- `src/config/schema.help.ts`
- `src/config/schema.labels.ts`
- `src/config/types.tools.ts`
- `docs/reference/memory-config.md`

Acceptance:

- Strict config accepts only the intended values.
- Runtime passes the selected GPU policy to `node-llama-cpp`.
- Docs explain the Apple Silicon CPU-only path and the performance tradeoff.
- Tests cover default behavior, CPU-only, Metal, and invalid config rejection.
- Docs avoid promising that CPU-only prevents every crash when the installed
  macOS arm64 package is still linked to Metal libraries.

### Isolate Local Embeddings In A Worker

Move local embedding execution out of the Gateway process.

Preferred shape:

- Gateway owns provider selection, config, timeouts, and memory fallback policy.
- A local embedding worker process owns `node-llama-cpp` import, model load,
  context creation, embedding calls, and cleanup.
- Gateway sends embed query and batch requests over a minimal JSON protocol.
- Worker exits or native aborts are reported as local provider failure.
- Memory search marks the local provider unhealthy with backoff instead of
  restart-looping the Gateway.
- The published package spawns a built worker entrypoint from `dist/`; source
  checkouts can use the existing development loader path only where the repo
  already supports that pattern.
- The worker protocol is private to the memory host package. Do not expose it as
  public plugin SDK.

Likely files:

- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings-worker.ts`
- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings-worker-child.ts`
- `packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.ts`
- `extensions/memory-core/src/memory/manager-embedding-ops.ts`
- `extensions/memory-core/src/memory/provider-adapters.ts`

Acceptance:

- A simulated worker crash rejects the current request and keeps the parent
  process alive.
- Repeated worker crashes trigger backoff.
- `close()` terminates the worker cleanly.
- Request cancellation tears down or ignores in-flight worker work safely.
- Logs identify local embedding worker failures without printing secrets.
- Packaged OpenClaw can locate and start the worker without relying on source
  checkout paths.

### Degrade Memory Cleanly After Worker Failures

Make repeated local embedding failures visible and non-fatal.

Behavior:

- `openclaw memory status --deep` should show local embeddings degraded or
  disabled after repeated worker crashes.
- Search should fall back according to configured memory fallback policy.
- No cloud fallback should happen unless the operator explicitly configured it.
- Error copy should recommend CPU-only local embeddings on Apple Silicon when
  Metal crashes are detected.

Files:

- `extensions/memory-core/src/memory/manager.ts`
- `extensions/memory-core/src/memory/manager-embedding-ops.ts`
- `src/commands/doctor-memory-search.ts`
- `src/cli` memory status code paths as needed

Acceptance:

- Status output distinguishes missing optional runtime, model load failure, and
  worker crash or abort.
- Tests cover degraded status and no accidental cloud fallback.

### Handle QMD As A Separate Subprocess Path

Handle QMD as a separate subprocess-backed path.

Behavior:

- Pass the configured CPU or Metal policy into QMD where QMD supports it.
- Treat non-zero QMD embedding exits as memory degradation with backoff.
- Keep `memory.qmd.searchMode = "search"` as the lexical-only mitigation that
  avoids semantic vector probes and embedding maintenance.
- Do not wrap QMD inside the same local embedding worker unless a later design
  proves that is simpler and safer than QMD's existing process boundary.

Acceptance:

- QMD status and doctor output can distinguish missing QMD, QMD embedding
  failure, and lexical-only mode.
- Tests cover QMD non-zero exits without causing a Gateway crash loop.

### Keep The Plugin Contract Bridge Optional

PR #84947 has landed, so the generic `embeddingProviders` contract is available.
Use it as follow-up wiring after the safety path is proven.

Guidance:

- Do not block worker isolation on the bridge.
- Bridge the worker-backed local provider into `embeddingProviders` only if the
  adapter stays small and preserves existing memory behavior.
- Keep current `memorySearch.local` compatibility while the bridge rolls out.

Acceptance:

- Existing memory local embeddings still work through the old path.
- New contract registration is additive and does not change operator defaults.

## Mac Proof Required

Final acceptance for #44202 requires Apple Silicon macOS proof. Linux source
tests are not enough because the reported failure is in `ggml-metal`.

Required real environment:

- Apple Silicon Mac.
- `node-llama-cpp` with the macOS arm64 Metal binary.
- The reported EmbeddingGemma GGUF model or equivalent small GGUF embedding
  model that exercises the Metal path.
- Local memory enabled with vector search.

Proof scenarios:

1. Baseline repro on current main or pre-fix branch:
   - Run local embedding query or memory indexing.
   - Trigger provider close, worker exit, or Gateway restart.
   - Capture the Metal abort or non-zero child exit when reproducible.
2. CPU-only policy after the fix:
   - Configure local embeddings with CPU-only policy.
   - Run index and search.
   - Restart or shut down the Gateway.
   - Confirm no Gateway crash.
3. Worker isolation after the fix:
   - Force the embedding worker to exit non-zero or abort in a test mode.
   - Confirm the Gateway stays alive.
   - Confirm memory status reports degraded local embeddings.
4. Metal policy after the fix:
   - Configure explicit Metal policy.
   - If native cleanup still aborts, confirm only the worker dies and the
     Gateway applies backoff.

## Local Test Plan

Use narrow local tests for implementation:

```sh
node scripts/run-vitest.mjs packages/memory-host-sdk/src/host/embeddings.test.ts
node scripts/run-vitest.mjs extensions/memory-core/src/memory/manager-embedding-ops.test.ts
node scripts/run-vitest.mjs src/commands/doctor-memory-search.test.ts
pnpm config:schema:check
pnpm config:docs:check
```

Before a fix branch is handed off or pushed for review, run the smallest changed
gate that covers the touched surface. Use Testbox or a macOS runner for broad or
platform-specific proof.

## Open Decisions

- Should Apple Silicon default to CPU-only for local embeddings, or should CPU
  remain an explicit operator choice? Defaulting to CPU-only needs maintainer
  approval because it changes performance expectations.
- Can the safety PR include worker isolation, GPU policy, status/backoff, and
  QMD subprocess handling without expanding into a provider-contract migration?
  If not, cut only the plugin bridge.
- Which QMD versions expose enough CPU/Metal controls for OpenClaw to pass policy
  through reliably?
- What is the exact backoff policy after repeated worker crashes?
- Should the `embeddingProviders` bridge be included only if it stays tiny and
  additive, or should it remain a small follow-up after Apple Silicon proof?

## One-PR Checklist

1. Serialize local `embedBatch`.
2. Add local embedding worker isolation.
3. Add `memorySearch.local.gpu: "auto" | "metal" | "cpu"` config and
   node-llama-cpp option plumbing.
4. Add memory degradation and status reporting.
5. Add QMD policy/status handling as a separate subprocess path.
6. Run Apple Silicon proof.
7. Update #44202 with exact commands, host class, result, and remaining gaps.
8. Bridge to the `embeddingProviders` contract only if it stays additive and
   small; otherwise leave it as a follow-up.
