# CI Pipeline

The CI runs on every push to `main` and every pull request. It uses smart scoping to skip expensive jobs when only unrelated areas changed.

## Job Overview

| Job                              | Purpose                                                                                      | When it runs                        |

## Fail-Fast Order

Jobs are ordered so cheap checks fail before expensive ones run:

1. `preflight` decides which lanes exist at all. The `docs-scope` and `changed-scope` logic are steps inside this job, not standalone jobs.
2. `security-scm-fast`, `security-dependency-audit`, `security-fast`, `check`, `check-additional`, `check-docs`, and `skills-python` fail quickly without waiting on the heavier artifact and platform matrix jobs.
3. `build-artifacts` overlaps with the fast Linux lanes so downstream consumers can start as soon as the shared build is ready.
4. Heavier platform and runtime lanes fan out after that: `checks-fast-core`, `checks-fast-contracts-channels`, `checks-node-extensions`, `checks-node-core-test`, `extension-fast`, `checks`, `checks-windows`, `macos-node`, `macos-swift`, and `android`.

Scope logic lives in `scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs` and is covered by unit tests in `src/scripts/ci-changed-scope.test.ts`.
The separate `install-smoke` workflow reuses the same scope script through its own `preflight` job. It computes `run_install_smoke` from the narrower changed-smoke signal, so Docker/install smoke only runs for install, packaging, and container-relevant changes.

Local changed-lane logic lives in `scripts/changed-lanes.mjs` and is executed by `scripts/check-changed.mjs`. That local gate is stricter about architecture boundaries than the broad CI platform scope: core production changes run core prod typecheck plus core tests, core test-only changes run only core test typecheck/tests, extension production changes run extension prod typecheck plus extension tests, and extension test-only changes run only extension test typecheck/tests. Public Plugin SDK or plugin-contract changes expand to extension validation because extensions depend on those core contracts. Unknown root/config changes fail safe to all lanes.

On pushes, the `checks` matrix adds the push-only `compat-node22` lane. On pull requests, that lane is skipped and the matrix stays focused on the normal test/channel lanes.

The slowest Node test families are split into include-file shards so each job stays small: channel contracts split registry and core coverage into eight weighted shards each, auto-reply reply command tests split into four include-pattern shards, and the other large auto-reply reply prefix groups split into two shards each. `check-additional` also separates package-boundary compile/canary work from runtime topology gateway/architecture work.

GitHub may mark superseded jobs as `cancelled` when a newer push lands on the same PR or `main` ref. Treat that as CI noise unless the newest run for the same ref is also failing. The aggregate shard checks call out this cancellation case explicitly so it is easier to distinguish from a test failure.

## Runners

| Runner                           | Jobs                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `blacksmith-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404`  | `preflight`, `security-scm-fast`, `security-dependency-audit`, `security-fast`, `build-artifacts`, Linux checks, docs checks, Python skills, `android` |
| `blacksmith-32vcpu-windows-2025` | `checks-windows`                                                                                                                                       |
| `macos-latest`                   | `macos-node`, `macos-swift`                                                                                                                            |

Blacksmith Linux jobs use `useblacksmith/checkout` so repeat CI runs can reuse the Blacksmith git mirror cache. Windows and macOS jobs stay on upstream `actions/checkout`.
