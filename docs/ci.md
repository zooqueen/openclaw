# CI Pipeline

The CI runs on every push to `main` and every pull request. It uses smart scoping to skip expensive jobs when only unrelated areas changed.

## Job Overview

## Fail-Fast Order

Jobs are ordered so cheap checks fail before expensive ones run:

1. `preflight` decides which lanes exist at all. The `docs-scope` and `changed-scope` logic are steps inside this job, not standalone jobs.
2. `security-scm-fast`, `security-dependency-audit`, `security-fast`, `check`, `check-additional`, `check-docs`, and `skills-python` fail quickly without waiting on the heavier artifact and platform matrix jobs.
3. `build-artifacts` overlaps with the fast Linux lanes so downstream consumers can start as soon as the shared build is ready.
4. Heavier platform and runtime lanes fan out after that: `checks-fast-core`, `checks-fast-contracts-channels`, `checks-node-extensions`, `checks-node-core-test`, PR-only `extension-fast`, `checks`, `checks-windows`, `macos-node`, `macos-swift`, and `android`.

Scope logic lives in `scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs` and is covered by unit tests in `src/scripts/ci-changed-scope.test.ts`.
CI workflow edits validate the Node CI graph plus workflow linting, but do not force Windows, Android, or macOS native builds by themselves; those platform lanes stay scoped to platform source changes.
Windows Node checks are scoped to Windows-specific process/path wrappers, npm/pnpm/UI runner helpers, package manager config, and the CI workflow surfaces that execute that lane; unrelated source, plugin, install-smoke, and test-only changes stay on the Linux Node lanes so they do not reserve a 16-vCPU Windows worker for coverage that is already exercised by the normal test shards.
The separate `install-smoke` workflow reuses the same scope script through its own `preflight` job. It computes `run_install_smoke` from the narrower changed-smoke signal, so Docker/install smoke runs for install, packaging, container-relevant changes, bundled extension production changes, and the core plugin/channel/gateway/Plugin SDK surfaces that the Docker smoke jobs exercise. Test-only and docs-only edits do not reserve Docker workers. Its QR package smoke forces the Docker `pnpm install` layer to rerun while preserving the BuildKit pnpm store cache, so it still exercises installation without redownloading dependencies on every run. Its gateway-network e2e reuses the runtime image built earlier in the job, so it adds real container-to-container WebSocket coverage without adding another Docker build. Local `test:docker:all` similarly prebuilds one shared `scripts/e2e/Dockerfile` built-app image and reuses it across the E2E container smoke runners. A separate `docker-e2e-fast` job runs the bounded bundled-plugin Docker profile under a 120-second command timeout: setup-entry dependency repair plus synthetic bundled-loader failure isolation. The full bundled update/channel matrix remains manual/full-suite because it performs repeated real npm update and doctor repair passes.

Local changed-lane logic lives in `scripts/changed-lanes.mjs` and is executed by `scripts/check-changed.mjs`. That local gate is stricter about architecture boundaries than the broad CI platform scope: core production changes run core prod typecheck plus core tests, core test-only changes run only core test typecheck/tests, extension production changes run extension prod typecheck plus extension tests, and extension test-only changes run only extension test typecheck/tests. Public Plugin SDK or plugin-contract changes expand to extension validation because extensions depend on those core contracts. Release metadata-only version bumps run targeted version/config/root-dependency checks. Unknown root/config changes fail safe to all lanes.

On pushes, the `checks` matrix adds the push-only `compat-node22` lane. On pull requests, that lane is skipped and the matrix stays focused on the normal test/channel lanes.

The slowest Node test families are split or balanced so each job stays small: channel contracts split registry and core coverage into six weighted shards total, bundled plugin tests balance across six extension workers, auto-reply runs as three balanced workers instead of six tiny workers, and agentic gateway/plugin configs are spread across the existing source-only agentic Node jobs instead of waiting on built artifacts. Broad browser, QA, media, and miscellaneous plugin tests use their dedicated Vitest configs instead of the shared plugin catch-all. The broad agents lane uses the shared Vitest file-parallel scheduler because it is import/scheduling dominated rather than owned by a single slow test file. `runtime-config` runs with the infra core-runtime shard to keep the shared runtime shard from owning the tail. `check-additional` keeps package-boundary compile/canary work together and separates runtime topology architecture from gateway watch coverage; the boundary guard shard runs its small independent guards concurrently inside one job. Gateway watch, channel tests, and the core support-boundary shard run concurrently inside `build-artifacts` after `dist/` and `dist-runtime/` are already built, keeping their old check names as lightweight verifier jobs while avoiding two extra Blacksmith workers and a second artifact-consumer queue.
Android CI runs both `testPlayDebugUnitTest` and `testThirdPartyDebugUnitTest`, then builds the Play debug APK. The third-party flavor has no separate source set or manifest; its unit-test lane still compiles that flavor with the SMS/call-log BuildConfig flags, while avoiding a duplicate debug APK packaging job on every Android-relevant push.
`extension-fast` is PR-only because push runs already execute the full bundled plugin shards. That keeps changed-plugin feedback for reviews without reserving an extra Blacksmith worker on `main` for coverage already present in `checks-node-extensions`.

GitHub may mark superseded jobs as `cancelled` when a newer push lands on the same PR or `main` ref. Treat that as CI noise unless the newest run for the same ref is also failing. Aggregate shard checks use `!cancelled() && always()` so they still report normal shard failures but do not queue after the whole workflow has already been superseded.
The CI concurrency key is versioned (`CI-v7-*`) so a GitHub-side zombie in an old queue group cannot indefinitely block newer main runs.
