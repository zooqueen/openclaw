Keep OpenClaw up to date.

## Recommended: `openclaw update`

The fastest way to update. It detects your install type (npm or git), fetches the latest version, runs `openclaw doctor`, and restarts the gateway.

```bash
openclaw update
```

To switch channels or target a specific version:

```bash
openclaw update --channel beta
openclaw update --channel dev
openclaw update --tag main
openclaw update --dry-run   # preview without applying
```

`--channel beta` prefers beta, but the runtime falls back to stable/latest when
the beta tag is missing or older than the latest stable release. Use `--tag beta`
if you want the raw npm beta dist-tag for a one-off package update.

See [Development channels](/install/development-channels) for channel semantics.

## Switch between npm and git installs

Use channels when you want to change the install type. The updater keeps your
state, config, credentials, and workspace in `~/.openclaw`; it only changes
which OpenClaw code install the CLI and gateway use.

```bash
# npm package install -> editable git checkout
openclaw update --channel dev

# git checkout -> npm package install
openclaw update --channel stable
```

Run with `--dry-run` first to preview the exact install-mode switch:

```bash
openclaw update --channel dev --dry-run
openclaw update --channel stable --dry-run
```

The `dev` channel ensures a git checkout, builds it, and installs the global CLI
from that checkout. The `stable` and `beta` channels use package installs. If the
gateway is already installed, `openclaw update` refreshes the service metadata
and restarts it unless you pass `--no-restart`.

## Alternative: re-run the installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Add `--no-onboard` to skip onboarding. To force a specific install type through
the installer, pass `--install-method git --no-onboard` or
`--install-method npm --no-onboard`.

## Alternative: manual npm, pnpm, or bun

```bash
npm i -g openclaw@latest
```

When `openclaw update` manages a global npm install, it first runs the normal
global install command. If that command fails, OpenClaw retries once with
`--omit=optional`. That retry helps hosts where native optional dependencies
cannot compile, while keeping the original failure visible if the fallback also
fails.

```bash
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

```bash
bun add -g openclaw@latest
```

### Global npm installs and runtime dependencies

OpenClaw treats packaged global installs as read-only at runtime, even when the
global package directory is writable by the current user. Bundled plugin runtime
dependencies are staged into a writable runtime directory instead of mutating the
package tree. This keeps `openclaw update` from racing with a running gateway or
local agent that is repairing plugin dependencies during the same install.

Some Linux npm setups install global packages under root-owned directories such
as `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw`. OpenClaw supports that layout through the
same external staging path.

For hardened systemd units, set a writable stage directory that is included in
`ReadWritePaths`:

```ini
Environment=OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR=/var/lib/openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/openclaw /home/openclaw/.openclaw /tmp
```

If `OPENCLAW_PLUGIN_STAGE_DIR` is not set, OpenClaw uses `$STATE_DIRECTORY` when
systemd provides it, then falls back to `~/.openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps`.
The repair step treats that stage as an OpenClaw-owned local package root and
ignores user npm prefix/global settings, so global-install npm config does not
redirect bundled plugin dependencies into `~/node_modules` or the global package
tree.

Before package updates and bundled runtime-dependency repairs, OpenClaw tries a
best-effort disk-space check for the target volume. Low space produces a warning
with the checked path, but does not block the update because filesystem quotas,
snapshots, and network volumes can change after the check. The actual npm
install, copy, and post-install verification remain authoritative.

### Bundled plugin runtime dependencies

Packaged installs keep bundled plugin runtime dependencies out of the read-only
package tree. On startup and during `openclaw doctor --fix`, OpenClaw repairs
runtime dependencies only for bundled plugins that are active in config, active
through legacy channel config, or enabled by their bundled manifest default.
Persisted channel auth state alone does not trigger Gateway startup
runtime-dependency repair.

Explicit disablement wins. A disabled plugin or channel does not get its
runtime dependencies repaired just because it exists in the package. External
plugins and custom load paths still use `openclaw plugins install` or
`openclaw plugins update`.

## Auto-updater

The auto-updater is off by default. Enable it in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  update: {
    channel: "stable",
    auto: {
      enabled: true,
      stableDelayHours: 6,
      stableJitterHours: 12,
      betaCheckIntervalHours: 1,
    },
  },
}
```

| Channel  | Behavior                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stable` | Waits `stableDelayHours`, then applies with deterministic jitter across `stableJitterHours` (spread rollout). |
| `beta`   | Checks every `betaCheckIntervalHours` (default: hourly) and applies immediately.                              |
| `dev`    | No automatic apply. Use `openclaw update` manually.                                                           |

The gateway also logs an update hint on startup (disable with `update.checkOnStart: false`).

## After updating

<Steps>

### Run doctor

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

Migrates config, audits DM policies, and checks gateway health. Details: [Doctor](/gateway/doctor)

### Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Verify

```bash
openclaw health
```

</Steps>

## Rollback

### Pin a version (npm)

```bash
npm i -g openclaw@<version>
openclaw doctor
openclaw gateway restart
```

Tip: `npm view openclaw version` shows the current published version.

### Pin a commit (source)

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout "$(git rev-list -n 1 --before=\"2026-01-01\" origin/main)"
pnpm install && pnpm build
openclaw gateway restart
```

To return to latest: `git checkout main && git pull`.

## If you are stuck

- Run `openclaw doctor` again and read the output carefully.
- For `openclaw update --channel dev` on source checkouts, the updater auto-bootstraps `pnpm` when needed. If you see a pnpm/corepack bootstrap error, install `pnpm` manually (or re-enable `corepack`) and rerun the update.
