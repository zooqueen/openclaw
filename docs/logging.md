OpenClaw has two main log surfaces:

- **File logs** (JSON lines) written by the Gateway.
- **Console output** shown in terminals and the Gateway Debug UI.

The Control UI **Logs** tab tails the gateway file log. This page explains where
logs live, how to read them, and how to configure log levels and formats.

## Where logs live

By default, the Gateway writes a rolling log file under:

`/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

The date uses the gateway host's local timezone.

Each file rotates when it reaches `logging.maxFileBytes` (default: 100 MB).
OpenClaw keeps up to five numbered archives beside the active file, such as
`openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.1.log`, and keeps writing to a fresh active log instead of
suppressing diagnostics.

You can override this in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "file": "/path/to/openclaw.log"
  }
}
```

## How to read logs

### CLI: live tail (recommended)

Use the CLI to tail the gateway log file via RPC:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

Useful current options:

- `--local-time`: render timestamps in your local timezone
- `--url <url>` / `--token <token>` / `--timeout <ms>`: standard Gateway RPC flags
- `--expect-final`: agent-backed RPC final-response wait flag (accepted here via the shared client layer)

Output modes:

- **TTY sessions**: pretty, colorized, structured log lines.
- **Non-TTY sessions**: plain text.
- `--json`: line-delimited JSON (one log event per line).
- `--plain`: force plain text in TTY sessions.
- `--no-color`: disable ANSI colors.

When you pass an explicit `--url`, the CLI does not auto-apply config or
environment credentials; include `--token` yourself if the target Gateway
requires auth.

In JSON mode, the CLI emits `type`-tagged objects:

- `meta`: stream metadata (file, cursor, size)
- `log`: parsed log entry
- `notice`: truncation / rotation hints
- `raw`: unparsed log line

If the local loopback Gateway asks for pairing, `openclaw logs` falls back to
the configured local log file automatically. Explicit `--url` targets do not
use this fallback.

If the Gateway is unreachable, the CLI prints a short hint to run:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

### Control UI (web)

The Control UI’s **Logs** tab tails the same file using `logs.tail`.
See [/web/control-ui](/web/control-ui) for how to open it.

### Channel-only logs

To filter channel activity (WhatsApp/Telegram/etc), use:

```bash
openclaw channels logs --channel whatsapp
```

## Log formats

### File logs (JSONL)

Each line in the log file is a JSON object. The CLI and Control UI parse these
entries to render structured output (time, level, subsystem, message).

### Console output

Console logs are **TTY-aware** and formatted for readability:

- Subsystem prefixes (e.g. `gateway/channels/whatsapp`)
- Level coloring (info/warn/error)
- Optional compact or JSON mode

Console formatting is controlled by `logging.consoleStyle`.

### Gateway WebSocket logs

`openclaw gateway` also has WebSocket protocol logging for RPC traffic:

- normal mode: only interesting results (errors, parse errors, slow calls)
- `--verbose`: all request/response traffic
- `--ws-log auto|compact|full`: pick the verbose rendering style
- `--compact`: alias for `--ws-log compact`

Examples:

```bash
openclaw gateway
openclaw gateway --verbose --ws-log compact
openclaw gateway --verbose --ws-log full
```

## Configuring logging

All logging configuration lives under `logging` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "file": "/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log",
    "consoleLevel": "info",
    "consoleStyle": "pretty",
    "redactSensitive": "tools",
    "redactPatterns": ["sk-.*"]
  }
}
```

### Log levels

- `logging.level`: **file logs** (JSONL) level.
- `logging.consoleLevel`: **console** verbosity level.

You can override both via the **`OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL`** environment variable (e.g. `OPENCLAW_LOG_LEVEL=debug`). The env var takes precedence over the config file, so you can raise verbosity for a single run without editing `openclaw.json`. You can also pass the global CLI option **`--log-level <level>`** (for example, `openclaw --log-level debug gateway run`), which overrides the environment variable for that command.

`--verbose` only affects console output and WS log verbosity; it does not change
file log levels.

### Trace correlation

File logs are JSONL. When a log call carries a valid diagnostic trace context,
OpenClaw writes the trace fields as top-level JSON keys (`traceId`, `spanId`,
`parentSpanId`, `traceFlags`) so external log processors can correlate the line
with OTEL spans and provider `traceparent` propagation.

### Console styles

`logging.consoleStyle`:

- `pretty`: human-friendly, colored, with timestamps.
- `compact`: tighter output (best for long sessions).
- `json`: JSON per line (for log processors).

### Redaction

OpenClaw can redact sensitive tokens before they hit console output, file logs,
OTLP log records, or persisted session transcript text:

- `logging.redactSensitive`: `off` | `tools` (default: `tools`)
- `logging.redactPatterns`: list of regex strings to override the default set

File logs and session transcripts stay JSONL, but matching secret values are
masked before the line or message is written to disk. Redaction is best-effort:
it applies to text-bearing message content and log strings, not every
identifier or binary payload field.

## Diagnostics and OpenTelemetry

Diagnostics are structured, machine-readable events for model runs and
message-flow telemetry (webhooks, queueing, session state). They do **not**
replace logs — they feed metrics, traces, and exporters. Events are emitted
in-process whether or not you export them.

Two adjacent surfaces:

- **OpenTelemetry export** — send metrics, traces, and logs over OTLP/HTTP to
  any OpenTelemetry-compatible collector or backend (Grafana, Datadog,
  Honeycomb, New Relic, Tempo, etc.). Full configuration, signal catalog,
  metric/span names, env vars, and privacy model live on a dedicated page:
  [OpenTelemetry export](/gateway/opentelemetry).
- **Diagnostics flags** — targeted debug-log flags that route extra logs to
  `logging.file` without raising `logging.level`. Flags are case-insensitive
  and support wildcards (`telegram.*`, `*`). Configure under `diagnostics.flags`
  or via the `OPENCLAW_DIAGNOSTICS=...` env override. Full guide:
  [Diagnostics flags](/diagnostics/flags).

To enable diagnostics events for plugins or custom sinks without OTLP export:

```json5
{
  diagnostics: { enabled: true },
}
```

For OTLP export to a collector, see [OpenTelemetry export](/gateway/opentelemetry).

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Gateway not reachable?** Run `openclaw doctor` first.
- **Logs empty?** Check that the Gateway is running and writing to the file path
  in `logging.file`.
- **Need more detail?** Set `logging.level` to `debug` or `trace` and retry.
