title: "npm shrinkwrap"
---

OpenClaw source checkouts use `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Published OpenClaw npm packages use `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, npm's publishable dependency lockfile, so package installs use the dependency graph reviewed during release.

## Why it matters

Shrinkwrap is a receipt for the dependency tree that ships with an npm package: it tells npm which exact transitive versions to install.

| File                  | Where it matters         | What it means                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml`      | OpenClaw source checkout | Maintainer dependency graph       |
| `npm-shrinkwrap.json` | Published npm package    | npm install graph for users       |
| `package-lock.json`   | Local npm apps           | Not the OpenClaw publish contract |

For OpenClaw releases this means:

- the published package does not ask npm to invent a fresh dependency graph at install time;
- dependency changes are reviewable because they land in a lockfile diff;
- release validation tests the same graph users will install;
- package-size or native-dependency surprises surface before publishing.

Shrinkwrap is not a sandbox. It does not make a dependency safe by itself, and it does not replace host isolation, `openclaw security audit`, package provenance, or install smoke tests.

OpenClaw is a gateway, plugin host, model router, and agent runtime, so a default install affects startup time, disk use, native package downloads, and supply-chain exposure. Shrinkwrap gives release review a stable boundary: reviewers see transitive dependency movement, validators reject unexpected lockfile drift, and plugin packages carry their own locked dependency graph instead of relying on the root package.

## Generating and checking

The root `openclaw` npm package and OpenClaw-owned npm plugin packages (for example `@openclaw/discord`) include `npm-shrinkwrap.json` when they publish. Suitable plugin packages can also publish with explicit `bundledDependencies`, carrying their runtime dependency files in the plugin tarball instead of relying only on install-time resolution.

```bash
# All shrinkwrap-managed packages (root + publishable plugins)
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:generate
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:check

# Root package only
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:root:generate
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:root:check

# Only packages affected by the current changeset
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:changed:generate
pnpm deps:shrinkwrap:changed:check
```

The generator resolves npm's publishable lock format but rejects generated package versions that are not already present in `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That keeps the pnpm dependency age, override, and patch-review boundary intact.

Review these as security-sensitive:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- bundled plugin dependency payloads
- any `package-lock.json` diff

OpenClaw package validators require shrinkwrap in new root package tarballs and reject `package-lock.json` for published packages. The plugin npm publish path checks plugin-local shrinkwrap, installs package-local bundled dependencies, then packs or publishes.

## Inspecting a published package

Root package:

```bash
npm pack openclaw@<version> --json --pack-destination /tmp/openclaw-pack
tar -tf /tmp/openclaw-pack/openclaw-<version>.tgz | grep '^package/npm-shrinkwrap.json$'
```

Plugin package:

```bash
npm pack @openclaw/discord@<version> --json --pack-destination /tmp/openclaw-plugin-pack
tar -tf /tmp/openclaw-plugin-pack/openclaw-discord-<version>.tgz | grep '^package/npm-shrinkwrap.json$'
tar -tf /tmp/openclaw-plugin-pack/openclaw-discord-<version>.tgz | grep '^package/node_modules/'
```
