summary: "Export OpenClaw diagnostics to OpenTelemetry collectors or stdout JSONL via the diagnostics-otel plugin"
title: "OpenTelemetry export"
read_when:
  - You want to send OpenClaw model usage, message flow, or session metrics to an OpenTelemetry collector
  - You are wiring traces, metrics, or logs into Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb, New Relic, Tempo, or another OTLP backend
  - You need the exact metric names, span names, or attribute shapes to build dashboards or alerts
---

OpenClaw exports diagnostics through the official `diagnostics-otel` plugin
using **OTLP/HTTP (protobuf)**. Logs can also be written as stdout JSONL for
container and sandbox log pipelines. Any collector or backend that accepts
OTLP/HTTP works without code changes. For local file logs, see
[Logging](/logging).

- **Diagnostics events** are structured, in-process records emitted by the
  Gateway and bundled plugins for model runs, message flow, sessions, queues,
  and exec.
- **`diagnostics-otel`** subscribes to those events and exports them as
  OpenTelemetry **metrics**, **traces**, and **logs** over OTLP/HTTP, and can
  mirror log records to stdout JSONL.
- **Provider calls** receive a W3C `traceparent` header from OpenClaw's
  trusted model-call span context when the provider transport accepts custom
  headers. Plugin-emitted trace context is not propagated.
- Exporters attach only when both the diagnostics surface and the plugin are
  enabled, so in-process cost stays near zero by default.

## Quick start

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:@openclaw/diagnostics-otel
```

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    allow: ["diagnostics-otel"],
    entries: {
      "diagnostics-otel": { enabled: true },
    },
  },
  diagnostics: {
    enabled: true,
    otel: {
      enabled: true,
      endpoint: "http://otel-collector:4318",
      protocol: "http/protobuf",
      serviceName: "openclaw-gateway",
      traces: true,
      metrics: true,
      logs: true,
      sampleRate: 0.2,
      flushIntervalMs: 60000,
    },
  },
}
```

Or enable the plugin from the CLI: `openclaw plugins enable diagnostics-otel`.

<Note>
`protocol` supports `http/protobuf` only. Since `traces` and `metrics` default to enabled, any other value (including `grpc`) aborts the entire diagnostics-otel subscription with an `unsupported protocol` warning - this also stops stdout log export. Explicitly set `traces: false` and `metrics: false` if you only want `logsExporter: "stdout"` with a non-OTLP protocol value.
</Note>

## Signals exported

| Signal      | What goes in it                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Metrics** | Counters/histograms for token usage, cost, run duration, failover, skill usage, message flow, Talk events, queue lanes, session state/recovery, tool execution, exec, memory, liveness, and exporter health. |
| **Traces**  | Spans for model usage, model calls, harness lifecycle, skill usage, tool execution, exec, webhook/message processing, context assembly, and tool loops.                                                      |
| **Logs**    | Structured `logging.file` records exported over OTLP or stdout JSONL when `diagnostics.otel.logs` is enabled; log bodies are withheld unless content capture is explicitly enabled.                          |

Toggle `traces`, `metrics`, and `logs` independently. Traces and metrics
default to on when `diagnostics.otel.enabled` is true; logs default to off
and export only when `diagnostics.otel.logs` is explicitly `true`. Log export
defaults to OTLP; set `diagnostics.otel.logsExporter` to `stdout` for JSONL on
stdout, or `both` for both.

## Privacy and content capture

Raw model/tool content is **not** exported by default. Spans carry bounded
identifiers (channel, provider, model, error category, hash-only request ids,
tool source, tool owner, skill name/source) and never include prompt text,
response text, tool inputs, tool outputs, skill file paths, or session keys.
Values that look like scoped agent session keys (for example starting with
`agent:`) are replaced with `unknown` on low-cardinality attributes. OTLP log
records keep severity, logger, code location, trusted trace context, and
sanitized attributes by default; the raw log message body is exported only
when `diagnostics.otel.captureContent` is boolean `true`. Granular
`captureContent.*` subkeys never enable log bodies. Talk metrics export only
bounded event metadata (mode, transport, provider, event type) - no
transcripts, audio payloads, session ids, turn ids, call ids, room ids, or
handoff tokens.

Outbound model requests may include a W3C `traceparent` header generated only
from OpenClaw-owned diagnostic trace context for the active model call.
Existing caller-supplied `traceparent` headers are replaced, so plugins or
custom provider options cannot spoof cross-service trace ancestry.

Set `diagnostics.otel.captureContent.*` to `true` only when your collector
and retention policy are approved for prompt, response, tool, or
system-prompt text. Each subkey is independent:

- `inputMessages` - user prompt content.
- `outputMessages` - model response content.
- `toolInputs` - tool argument payloads.
- `toolOutputs` - tool result payloads.
- `systemPrompt` - assembled system/developer prompt.
- `toolDefinitions` - model tool names, descriptions, and schemas.

When any subkey is enabled, model and tool spans get bounded, redacted
`openclaw.content.*` attributes for that class only.

<Note>
Boolean `captureContent: true` enables `inputMessages`, `outputMessages`, `toolInputs`, `toolOutputs`, `toolDefinitions`, and OTLP log bodies together, but **not** `systemPrompt` - set `captureContent.systemPrompt: true` explicitly if you also need the assembled system prompt.
</Note>

`toolInputs`/`toolOutputs` content is captured for the built-in agent
runtime's tool executions (`openclaw.content.tool_input` and
`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` on completed/error spans;
`openclaw.content.tool_output` and `gen_ai.tool.call.result` on completed
spans). The `openclaw.content.*` names remain the stable OpenClaw attribute
names; the `gen_ai.tool.call.*` copies mirror them for semconv-native viewers.
External harness tool calls (Codex, Claude CLI) emit
`tool.execution.*` spans without content payloads. Captured content travels on a
trusted, listener-only channel and is never placed on the public diagnostic event
bus.

## Sampling and flushing

- **Traces:** `diagnostics.otel.sampleRate` sets a `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler`
  on the root span only (`0.0` drops all, `1.0` keeps all). Unset uses the
  OpenTelemetry SDK default (always-on).
- **Metrics:** `diagnostics.otel.flushIntervalMs` (clamped to a minimum of
  `1000`); unset uses the SDK's periodic-export default.
- **Logs:** OTLP logs respect `logging.level` (file log level) and use the
  diagnostic log-record redaction path, not console formatting. High-volume
  installs should prefer OTLP collector sampling/filtering over local
  sampling. Set `diagnostics.otel.logsExporter: "stdout"` when your platform
  already ships stdout/stderr to a log processor and you have no OTLP logs
  collector. Stdout records are one JSON object per line with `ts`, `signal`,
  `service.name`, severity, body, redacted attributes, and trusted trace
  fields when available.
- **File-log correlation:** JSONL file logs include top-level `traceId`,
  `spanId`, `parentSpanId`, and `traceFlags` when the log call carries a valid
  diagnostic trace context, letting log processors join local log lines with
  exported spans.
- **Request correlation:** Gateway HTTP requests and WebSocket frames create
  an internal request trace scope. Logs and diagnostic events inside that
  scope inherit the request trace by default, while agent run and model-call
  spans are created as children so provider `traceparent` headers stay on the
  same trace.
- **Model-call correlation:** `openclaw.model.call` spans include safe prompt
  component sizes by default and per-call token attributes when the provider
  result exposes usage. `openclaw.model.usage` remains the run-level
  accounting span for aggregate cost, context, and channel dashboards, and
  stays on the same diagnostic trace when the emitting runtime has trusted
  trace context.

### Model-call observation units

Every `openclaw.model.call` span identifies what its lifecycle measures through
`openclaw.model_call.observation_unit`:

- `request` - one observable model/provider request. Native embedded model
  calls use this unit, and exporters treat a missing value as `request` for
  compatibility with older or external emitters.
- `turn` - one opaque agent CLI turn that may contain hidden model requests,
  retries, tool work, or background work. Claude Code CLI and Codex app-server
  calls use this unit.

Both units remain model-call spans so trace backends can render model input,
output, usage, and hierarchy. Request spans use the API-derived GenAI operation
(`chat`, `generate_content`, or `text_completion`), while turn spans use
`gen_ai.operation.name = invoke_agent`. Both contribute to
`gen_ai.client.operation.duration`, where the operation name keeps direct
request latency separate from full-turn latency. OpenClaw's OTEL model-call
metrics also include `openclaw.model_call.observation_unit`; the Prometheus
model-call metrics expose the equivalent `observation_unit` label.

### Claude Code CLI model-call fidelity

Claude Code CLI turns emit one synthetic, turn-level `openclaw.model.call`
span. These are not Anthropic HTTP request spans. They use `openclaw.api =
claude-code`, `openclaw.model_call.observation_unit = turn`, and identify
the operation as `gen_ai.operation.name = invoke_agent`. They identify
OpenClaw's CLI boundary through
`openclaw.transport`:

- `stdio` - one-shot local Claude Code process.
- `stdio-live` - one turn on a managed persistent Claude stdio session.
- `paired-node-cli` - one-shot Claude Code execution delegated to a paired
  node.

OpenClaw gives Claude CLI turns the same ownership hierarchy used by other
agent runtimes: `openclaw.harness.run` (`openclaw.harness.id = claude-cli`)
contains `openclaw.run`, which contains the Claude `openclaw.model.call`
span. The harness and run spans are synthetic OpenClaw turn boundaries, not
Claude Code internal phases. One-shot and managed stdio turns use the same
hierarchy; a real fresh-session retry creates another model-call child inside
the same OpenClaw run.

The span starts when OpenClaw admits the prepared CLI turn and ends only after
that turn succeeds or fails. For managed sessions, an interim success result
does not end the span while Claude reports result-holding background agents or
workflows; the final post-drain result does. Abort, timeout, process failure,
output/parse failure, and other turn failures end the same span with an error.

Claude Code reports per-assistant-message usage and may also report cumulative
usage on its terminal result. OpenClaw reply accounting continues to use the
last assistant message so existing cost semantics do not change; the
turn-level model-call span uses terminal cumulative usage when available,
including cache-read and cache-creation tokens.

For these CLI spans, byte and timing fields describe the observable OpenClaw
CLI boundary:

- `openclaw.model_call.request_bytes` is the UTF-8 size of the prompt value
  sent over one-shot stdin/argv, or the managed stdio JSONL user envelope. It
  is not the size of Claude Code's hidden model request.
- `openclaw.model_call.response_bytes` is the UTF-8 size of Claude CLI stdout
  observed during the turn. It is not Anthropic HTTP response size.
- `openclaw.model_call.time_to_first_byte_ms` is time to the first observable
  Claude CLI stdout or stderr output. It is not network TTFB.

With the matching granular `captureContent` fields enabled, the span exports
the effective prompt OpenClaw sends to Claude Code, OpenClaw's appended system
prompt, and visible assistant text/reasoning/tool-call identity through
`gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`, and
`gen_ai.system_instructions`. Tool arguments, opaque thinking signatures, and
tool results are omitted from the Claude assistant envelope. OpenClaw does not
claim access to Claude Code's private system prompt, hidden resumed or
compacted request payload, native internal tool schemas, raw Anthropic HTTP
request, internal retries, upstream request id, or true network TTFB. Because
Claude Code does not expose its effective native tool definitions accurately,
these spans do not populate `gen_ai.tool.definitions`.

External Claude harness tool spans remain metadata-only even when tool content
capture is enabled. As with every model span, captured Claude CLI content uses
the trusted listener-only path and the exporter's existing redaction and size
bounds; content remains off by default.

- `openclaw.run.attempt` (counter, attrs: `openclaw.attempt`)

### Session liveness telemetry

`diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs` is the no-progress age threshold for session
liveness diagnostics. A `processing` session does not age toward this
threshold while OpenClaw observes reply, tool, status, block, or ACP runtime
progress. Typing keepalives do not count as progress, so a silent model or
harness can still be detected.

OpenClaw classifies sessions by the work it can still observe:

- `session.long_running`: active embedded work, model calls, or tool calls
  are still making progress. Owned model calls that stay silent past
  `diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs` also report as long-running before
  `diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs`, so slow or non-streaming model providers
  do not look like stalled gateway sessions while abort-observable.
- `session.stalled`: active work exists, but the active run has not reported
  recent progress. Owned model calls switch from `session.long_running` to
  `session.stalled` at or after `diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs`; ownerless
  stale model/tool activity is not treated as harmless long-running work.
  Stalled embedded runs stay observe-only at first, then abort-drain after
  `diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs` with no progress so queued turns behind
  the lane can resume. When unset, the abort threshold defaults to the safer
  extended window of at least 5 minutes and 3x
  `diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs`.
- `session.stuck`: stale session bookkeeping with no active work, or an idle
  queued session with stale ownerless model/tool activity. This releases the
  affected session lane immediately after recovery gates pass.

Recovery emits structured `session.recovery.requested` and
`session.recovery.completed` events. Diagnostic session state is marked idle
only after a mutating recovery outcome (`aborted` or `released`) and only if
the same processing generation is still current.

Only `session.stuck` emits the `openclaw.session.stuck` counter, the
`openclaw.session.stuck_age_ms` histogram, and the `openclaw.session.stuck`
span. Repeated `session.stuck` diagnostics back off while the session remains
unchanged, so dashboards should alert on sustained increases rather than
every heartbeat tick. For the config knob and defaults, see
[Configuration reference](/gateway/configuration-reference#diagnostics).

Liveness warnings also emit:

- `openclaw.liveness.warning` (counter, attrs: `openclaw.liveness.reason`)
- `openclaw.liveness.event_loop_delay_p99_ms` (histogram, attrs: `openclaw.liveness.reason`)

- `openclaw.tool.execution.blocked` (counter, attrs: `gen_ai.tool.name`, `openclaw.toolName`, `openclaw.tool.source`, `openclaw.tool.owner`, `openclaw.tool.params.kind`, `openclaw.deniedReason`)
- `openclaw.tool.loop` (counter, attrs: `openclaw.toolName`, `openclaw.loop.level`, `openclaw.loop.action`, `openclaw.loop.detector`, `openclaw.loop.count`, optional `openclaw.loop.paired_tool`; emitted when a repetitive tool-call loop is detected)

### Exec

## Exported spans

- `openclaw.model.usage`
  - `openclaw.channel`, `openclaw.provider`, `openclaw.model`
  - `openclaw.tokens.*` (input/output/cache_read/cache_write/total)
  - `gen_ai.system` by default, or `gen_ai.provider.name` when the latest GenAI semantic conventions are opted in
  - `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.usage.*`

  - With `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=gen_ai_latest_experimental`, request spans use the latest GenAI inference span name `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`. Turn spans use `invoke_agent` because OpenClaw does not claim a native agent name from the opaque CLI boundary. Both use `CLIENT` span kind instead of `openclaw.model.call`.

When content capture is explicitly enabled, model and tool spans can also
include bounded, redacted `openclaw.content.*` attributes for the specific
content classes you opted into.

## Diagnostic event catalog

The events below back the metrics and spans above. Plugins can also
subscribe to them directly without OTLP export.

**Model usage**

- `model.usage` - tokens, cost, duration, context, provider/model/channel,
  session ids. `usage` is provider/turn accounting for cost and telemetry;
  `context.used` is the current prompt/context snapshot and can be lower than
  provider `usage.total` when cached input or tool-loop calls are involved.

**Message flow**

- `webhook.received` / `webhook.processed` / `webhook.error`
- `message.queued` / `message.processed`
- `message.delivery.started` / `message.delivery.completed` / `message.delivery.error`

**Queue and session**

- `queue.lane.enqueue` / `queue.lane.dequeue`
- `session.state` / `session.long_running` / `session.stalled` / `session.stuck`
- `run.attempt` / `run.progress`
- `diagnostic.heartbeat` (aggregate counters: webhooks/queue/session)

**Harness lifecycle**

- `harness.run.started` / `harness.run.completed` / `harness.run.error` -
  per-run lifecycle for the agent harness. Includes `harnessId`, optional
  `pluginId`, provider/model/channel, and run id. Completion adds
  `durationMs`, `outcome`, optional `resultClassification`, `yieldDetected`,
  and `itemLifecycle` counts. Errors add `phase`
  (`prepare`/`start`/`send`/`resolve`/`cleanup`), `errorCategory`, and
  optional `cleanupFailed`.

**Exec**

- `exec.process.completed` - terminal outcome, duration, target, mode, exit
  code, and failure kind. Command text and working directories are not
  included.
- `exec.approval.followup_suppressed` - stale approval follow-up dropped
  after a session rebound. Includes `approvalId`, `reason`
  (`session_rebound`), `phase` (`direct_delivery` or `gateway_preflight`),
  and the dispatcher timestamp. Session keys, routes, and command text are
  not included.

## Without an exporter

Keep diagnostics events available to plugins or custom sinks without running
`diagnostics-otel`:

```json5
{
  diagnostics: { enabled: true },
}
```

For targeted debug output without raising `logging.level`, use diagnostics
flags. Flags are case-insensitive and support wildcards (`telegram.*` or
`*`):

```json5
{
  diagnostics: { flags: ["telegram.http"] },
}
```

Or as a one-off env override:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DIAGNOSTICS=telegram.http,telegram.payload openclaw gateway
```

Flag output goes to the standard log file (`logging.file`) and is still
redacted by `logging.redactSensitive`. Full guide:
[Diagnostics flags](/diagnostics/flags).

## Disable

```json5
{
  diagnostics: { otel: { enabled: false } },
}
```

Or leave `diagnostics-otel` out of `plugins.allow`, or run
`openclaw plugins disable diagnostics-otel`.
