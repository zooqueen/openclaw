OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale **Serve** (tailnet) or **Funnel** (public) for the Gateway dashboard and WebSocket port. This keeps the gateway bound to loopback while Tailscale provides HTTPS, routing, and (for Serve) identity headers.

## Modes

`gateway.tailscale.mode`:

| Mode            | Behavior                                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serve`         | Tailnet-only Serve via `tailscale serve`. The gateway stays on `127.0.0.1`. |
| `funnel`        | Public HTTPS via `tailscale funnel`. Requires a shared password.            |
| `off` (default) | No Tailscale automation.                                                    |

Status and audit output use **Tailscale exposure** for this OpenClaw Serve/Funnel mode. `off` means OpenClaw is not managing Serve or Funnel; it does not mean the local Tailscale daemon is stopped or logged out.

## Config examples

### Tailnet-only (Serve)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "serve" },
  },
}
```

Open: `https://<magicdns>/` (or your configured `gateway.controlUi.basePath`)

To expose the Control UI through a named Tailscale Service instead of the device hostname, set `gateway.tailscale.serviceName` to the Service name:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "serve", serviceName: "svc:openclaw" },
  },
}
```

Startup then reports the Service URL as `https://openclaw.<tailnet-name>.ts.net/` instead of the device hostname. Tailscale Services require the host to be an approved tagged node in your tailnet — configure the tag and approve the Service in Tailscale before enabling this, otherwise `tailscale serve --service=...` fails during gateway startup.

### Tailnet-only (bind to Tailnet IP)

Use this to have the gateway listen directly on the Tailnet IP, with no Serve/Funnel:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "tailnet",
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-token" },
  },
}
```

Connect from another Tailnet device:

- Control UI: `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`
- WebSocket: `ws://<tailscale-ip>:18789`

<Note>
Loopback (`http://127.0.0.1:18789`) will **not** work in this mode.
</Note>

### Public internet (Funnel + shared password)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "loopback",
    tailscale: { mode: "funnel" },
    auth: { mode: "password", password: "replace-me" },
  },
}
```

Prefer `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` over committing a password to disk.

## CLI examples

```bash
openclaw gateway --tailscale serve
openclaw gateway --tailscale funnel --auth password
```

## Auth

`gateway.auth.mode` controls the handshake:

| Mode                                                   | Use case                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`                                                 | Private ingress only                                                                |
| `token` (default when `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set) | Shared token                                                                        |
| `password`                                             | Shared secret via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` or config                             |
| `trusted-proxy`                                        | Identity-aware reverse proxy; see [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth) |

### Tailscale identity headers (Serve only)

When `tailscale.mode: "serve"` and `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`, Control UI/WebSocket auth can use Tailscale identity headers (`tailscale-user-login`) instead of a token/password. OpenClaw verifies the header by resolving the request's `x-forwarded-for` address via the local Tailscale daemon (`tailscale whois`) and matching it to the header login before accepting it. A request only qualifies for this path when it arrives from loopback carrying Tailscale's `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, and `x-forwarded-host` headers.

This tokenless flow assumes the gateway host is trusted. If untrusted local code may run on the same host, set `gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false` and require token/password auth instead.

Scope of the bypass:

- Applies only to the Control UI WebSocket auth surface. HTTP API endpoints (`/v1/*`, `/tools/invoke`, `/api/channels/*`, etc.) never use Tailscale identity-header auth; they always follow the gateway's normal HTTP auth mode.
- For Control UI operator sessions that already carry browser device identity, a verified Tailscale identity skips the bootstrap-token/QR pairing round trip.
- It does not bypass device identity itself: device-less clients are still rejected, and node-role connections still go through normal pairing and auth checks.

## Notes

- Tailscale Serve/Funnel requires the `tailscale` CLI installed and logged in.
- `tailscale.mode: "funnel"` refuses to start unless auth mode is `password`, to avoid public exposure.
- `gateway.tailscale.serviceName` applies only to Serve mode and is passed to `tailscale serve --service=<name>`. The value must use Tailscale's `svc:<dns-label>` format, for example `svc:openclaw`. Tailscale requires Service hosts to be tagged nodes, and the Service may need admin-console approval before Serve can publish it.
- `gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit` undoes `tailscale serve`/`tailscale funnel` configuration on shutdown.
- `gateway.tailscale.preserveFunnel: true` keeps an externally configured `tailscale funnel` route alive across gateway restarts. With `mode: "serve"`, OpenClaw checks `tailscale funnel status` before re-applying Serve and skips it when a Funnel route already covers the gateway port. The OpenClaw-managed Funnel password-only policy is unchanged.
- `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` is a direct Tailnet bind (no HTTPS, no Serve/Funnel).
- `gateway.bind: "auto"` prefers loopback; use `tailnet` for Tailnet-only binding.
- Serve/Funnel only expose the **Gateway control UI + WS**. Nodes connect over the same Gateway WS endpoint, so Serve works for node access too.

### Tailscale prerequisites and limits

- Serve requires HTTPS enabled for your tailnet; the CLI prompts if it is missing.
- Serve injects Tailscale identity headers; Funnel does not.
- Funnel requires Tailscale v1.38.3+, MagicDNS, HTTPS enabled, and a funnel node attribute.
- Funnel only supports ports `443`, `8443`, and `10000` over TLS.
- Funnel on macOS requires the open-source Tailscale app variant.

## Browser control (remote Gateway + local browser)

To run the Gateway on one machine but drive a browser on another, run a **node host** on the browser machine and keep both on the same tailnet. The Gateway proxies browser actions to the node; no separate control server or Serve URL is needed.

Avoid Funnel for browser control; treat node pairing like operator access.
