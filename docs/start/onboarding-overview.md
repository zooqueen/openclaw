OpenClaw has terminal and macOS app onboarding. Both establish inference first:
they detect existing AI access, require a live completion, and only then start
Crestodian to configure the remaining setup. A reachable, configured Gateway
whose default agent already has a configured model skips onboarding and opens
the normal agent UI. The terminal flow also offers the full classic wizard for
detailed setup.

## Which path should I use?

|                | CLI onboarding                         | macOS app onboarding             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Platforms**  | macOS, Linux, Windows (native or WSL2) | macOS only                       |
| **Interface**  | Inference setup, then Crestodian       | Inference setup, then Crestodian |
| **Best for**   | Servers, headless, full control        | Desktop Mac, visual setup        |
| **Automation** | `--non-interactive` for scripts        | Manual only                      |
| **Command**    | `openclaw onboard`                     | Launch the app                   |

Most users should start with **CLI onboarding** — it works everywhere and gives
you the most control.

## What onboarding configures

The guided inference phase establishes only:

1. **Model provider and auth** — detected access or a verified provider sign-in,
   API key, or token
2. **Verified inference** — a real completion on the default agent's effective
   model

After that completion passes, Crestodian can configure the workspace, Gateway,
Gateway service, channels, agents, plugins, and other optional features.

The classic CLI wizard can additionally configure:

1. **Channels** (optional) — built-in and bundled chat channels such as
   Discord, Feishu, Google Chat, iMessage, Mattermost, Microsoft Teams,
   Telegram, WhatsApp, and more
2. **Advanced Gateway controls** — remote mode, network settings, and daemon choices

## CLI onboarding

Run in any terminal:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

The guided flow detects existing AI access, live-tests candidates in order,
and falls through on failure. If detection is exhausted, it shows OpenAI,
Anthropic, xAI (Grok), Google, and OpenRouter first. **More…** contains the
remaining providers in provider groups, with regions, plans, and supported
browser, device, API-key, or token methods in a second menu. It saves the model
and credential only after a passing completion, then starts Crestodian to
configure the workspace, Gateway, channels, agents, plugins, and other optional
features. **Skip for now** exits without starting Crestodian. There is no
in-flow classic handoff; exit and run `openclaw onboard --classic` when you want
the classic wizard instead.

After inference passes, Crestodian can hand channel setup to a masked terminal
wizard. It does not open guided or classic provider setup; exit Crestodian and
run `openclaw onboard` to change the model provider or its authentication.

Use `openclaw onboard --classic` for detailed model/auth, channel, skill,
remote Gateway, or import setup. Adding `--install-daemon` also selects the
classic flow and installs the background service in one step. Use `openclaw
crestodian` for conversational non-inference setup and repair. `openclaw
onboard --modern` is a compatibility alias that uses the same live-inference
gate.

## macOS app onboarding

Open the OpenClaw app. If its configured local or remote Gateway is reachable
and the default agent already has a configured model, the app skips onboarding
and Crestodian and opens the normal agent UI immediately.

For a fresh or incomplete Gateway, the first-run flow detects existing AI
access (Claude Code, Codex, or API keys), live-tests the best
option, and saves it only after a real reply — falling back automatically and
offering a verified manual API-key step when nothing is found. Sensitive
credentials use masked input. Once inference passes, Crestodian starts and
helps configure the rest.

Gemini CLI remains available for normal agents after setup, but it is not
offered for this inference gate because it cannot enforce the tool-free probe.

## Custom or unlisted providers

If your provider is not listed, run `openclaw onboard --classic`, choose
**Custom Provider**, and enter:

- Endpoint compatibility: OpenAI-compatible (`/chat/completions`), OpenAI Responses-compatible (`/responses`), Anthropic-compatible (`/messages`), or unknown (probes all three and auto-detects)
- Base URL and API key (API key is optional if the endpoint does not require one)
- Model ID and optional model alias

Multiple custom endpoints can coexist — each gets its own endpoint ID.
