# Voice Wake & Push-to-Talk

## Requirements

Voice Wake and push-to-talk require macOS 26 or newer. On older macOS the controls are hidden from the Voice settings page, which shows the macOS 26 requirement instead.

## Modes

- **Wake-word mode** (default): an always-on Speech recognizer waits for trigger tokens (`swabbleTriggerWords`). On match it starts capture, shows the overlay with partial text, and auto-sends after silence.
- **Push-to-talk (hold Right Option)**: hold the right Option key to capture immediately, no trigger needed. The overlay appears while held; releasing finalizes and forwards after a short delay so you can edit the text.

## Runtime behavior (wake-word)

- The recognizer lives in `VoiceWakeRuntime`.
- Trigger fires only when there is a meaningful pause between the wake word and the next word (`triggerPauseWindow` = 0.55s). The overlay/chime can start on the pause even before the command begins.
- Silence windows: 2.0s (`silenceWindow`) when speech is flowing, 5.0s (`triggerOnlySilenceWindow`) if only the trigger was heard.
- Hard stop: 120s (`captureHardStop`) to prevent runaway sessions.
- Debounce between sessions: 350ms (`debounceAfterSend`) after a send.
- The overlay is driven via `VoiceWakeOverlayController`, with committed/volatile text coloring.
- After send, the recognizer restarts cleanly to listen for the next trigger.

## Lifecycle invariants

- If Voice Wake is enabled and permissions are granted, the wake-word recognizer stays listening, except during an active push-to-talk capture.
- Overlay dismissal, including manual dismiss via the X button, always resumes the recognizer: `VoiceSessionCoordinator.overlayDidDismiss` calls `VoiceWakeRuntime.refresh(state:)` on every dismiss path. See [Voice overlay](/platforms/mac/voice-overlay) for the session/token model.

## Push-to-talk specifics

- Hotkey detection uses a global `.flagsChanged` monitor for right Option (`keyCode 61` + `.option`). It only observes events, never swallows them.
- Capture lives in `VoicePushToTalk`: starts Speech immediately, streams partials to the overlay, and calls `VoiceWakeForwarder` on release.
- Starting push-to-talk pauses the wake-word runtime to avoid dueling audio taps; it restarts automatically after release.
- Permissions: requires Microphone + Speech; receiving key events needs Accessibility/Input Monitoring approval.
- External keyboards: some do not expose right Option as expected. Offer a fallback shortcut if users report misses.

## User-facing settings

- **Voice Wake** toggle: enables the wake-word runtime.
- **Hold Right Option to talk**: enables the push-to-talk monitor.
- Language and mic pickers, a live level meter, a trigger-word table, and a tester (local-only, never forwards).
- The mic picker preserves the last selection if a device disconnects, shows a disconnected hint, and temporarily falls back to the system default until it returns.
- **Sounds**: chimes on trigger detect and on send, defaulting to the macOS "Glass" system sound. Pick any `NSSound`-loadable file (e.g. MP3/WAV/AIFF) per event, or choose **No Sound**.

## Forwarding behavior

- On forward, `VoiceWakeForwarder.selectedSessionOptions` picks the active WebChat session key if one is set, otherwise the gateway's main session key.
- It looks up that session via `sessions.list` and derives the delivery channel and target from the session's delivery context (falling back to its last channel/target, then to a parsed session key), defaulting to WebChat if nothing resolves.
- If delivery fails, the error is logged (`voicewake.forward` category) and the run is still visible via WebChat/session logs.

## Forwarding payload

- `VoiceWakeForwarder.prefixedTranscript(_:)` prepends a machine-hint line (resolved host name, falling back to "this Mac") before the transcript, shared between wake-word and push-to-talk paths.

## Quick verification

- Toggle push-to-talk on, hold Right Option, speak, release: overlay should show partials then send.
- While holding, the menu-bar ears should stay enlarged (`triggerVoiceEars(ttl: nil)`); they drop after release.
