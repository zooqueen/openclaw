# macOS developer setup

Build and run the OpenClaw macOS application from source.

## Prerequisites

- **Xcode 26.2+** (Swift 6.2 toolchain), on the latest macOS available in
  Software Update.
- **Node.js 24 & pnpm** for the gateway, CLI, and packaging scripts. Node
  22.19+ also works.

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 2. Build and package the app

```bash
./scripts/package-mac-app.sh
```

Outputs `dist/OpenClaw.app`. Without an Apple Developer ID certificate, the
script falls back to ad-hoc signing.

For dev run modes, signing flags, and Team ID troubleshooting, see
[apps/macos/README.md](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/apps/macos/README.md).
Fast dev loop from repo root: `scripts/restart-mac.sh` (add `--no-sign` for
ad-hoc signing; TCC permissions do not stick with `--no-sign`).

<Note>
Ad-hoc signed apps may trigger security prompts. If the app crashes
immediately with "Abort trap 6", see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
</Note>

## 3. Install the CLI and Gateway

The packaged app embeds the canonical `scripts/install-cli.sh` installer. On a
fresh profile, choose **This Mac** during onboarding; the app installs the
matching user-space CLI and runtime before starting the Gateway wizard.

For manual development recovery, install the matching CLI yourself:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@<version>
```

`pnpm add -g openclaw@<version>` and `bun add -g openclaw@<version>` also
work. Node remains the recommended runtime for the Gateway itself.

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails: toolchain or SDK mismatch

The macOS app build expects the latest macOS SDK and the Swift 6.2 toolchain
(Xcode 26.2+).

```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcrun swift --version
```

If versions don't match, update macOS/Xcode and re-run the build.

### App crashes on permission grant

If the app crashes when you try to allow **Speech Recognition** or
**Microphone** access, it may be a corrupted TCC cache or signature mismatch.

1. Reset TCC permissions for the debug bundle id:

   ```bash
   tccutil reset All ai.openclaw.mac.debug
   ```

2. If that fails, temporarily change `BUNDLE_ID` in
   [`scripts/package-mac-app.sh`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/scripts/package-mac-app.sh)
   to force a clean slate from macOS.

### Gateway "Starting..." indefinitely

Check whether a zombie process holds the port:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway stop

# If you're not using a LaunchAgent (dev mode / manual runs), find the listener:
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

If a manual run holds the port, stop it (Ctrl+C), or kill the PID found above
as a last resort.
