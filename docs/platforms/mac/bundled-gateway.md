title: "Gateway on macOS"
---

OpenClaw.app no longer bundles Node/Bun or the Gateway runtime. The macOS app
expects an **external** `openclaw` CLI install, does not spawn the Gateway as a
child process, and manages a per-user launchd service to keep the Gateway
running (or attaches to an existing local Gateway if one is already running).

## Install the CLI (required for local mode)

Node 24 is the default runtime on the Mac. Node 22 LTS, currently `22.19+`, still works for compatibility. Then install `openclaw` globally:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@<version>
```

The macOS app's **Install CLI** button runs the same global install flow the app
uses internally: it prefers npm first, then pnpm, then bun if that is the only
detected package manager. Node remains the recommended Gateway runtime.

## Launchd (Gateway as LaunchAgent)

Label:

- `ai.openclaw.gateway` (or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*` may remain)

Plist location (per-user):

- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`
  (or `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.<profile>.plist`)

Manager:

- The macOS app owns LaunchAgent install/update in Local mode.
- The CLI can also install it: `openclaw gateway install`.

Behavior:

- "OpenClaw Active" enables/disables the LaunchAgent.
- App quit does **not** stop the gateway (launchd keeps it alive).
- If a Gateway is already running on the configured port, the app attaches to
  it instead of starting a new one.

Logging:

- launchd stdout: `~/Library/Logs/openclaw/gateway.log` (profiles use `gateway-<profile>.log`)
- launchd stderr: suppressed

## Version compatibility

The macOS app checks the gateway version against its own version. If they're
incompatible, update the global CLI to match the app version.

## State directory on macOS

Keep OpenClaw state on a local, non-synced disk. Avoid iCloud Drive and other
cloud-synced folders because sync latency and file locks can affect sessions,
credentials, and Gateway state.

Set `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` to a local path only when you need an override.
`openclaw doctor` warns about common cloud-synced state paths and recommends
moving back to local storage. See
[environment variables](/help/environment#path-related-env-vars) and
[Doctor](/gateway/doctor).

## Debug app connectivity

Use the macOS debug CLI from a source checkout to exercise the same Gateway
WebSocket handshake and discovery logic the app uses:

```bash
cd apps/macos
swift run openclaw-mac connect --json
swift run openclaw-mac discover --timeout 3000 --json
```

`connect` accepts `--url`, `--token`, `--timeout`, and `--json`. `discover`
accepts `--timeout`, `--json`, and `--include-local`. Compare discovery output
with `openclaw gateway discover --json` when you need to separate CLI discovery
from app-side connection issues.

## Smoke check

```bash
openclaw --version

OPENCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1 \
OPENCLAW_SKIP_CANVAS_HOST=1 \
openclaw gateway --port 18999 --bind loopback
```

Then:

```bash
openclaw gateway call health --url ws://127.0.0.1:18999 --timeout 3000
```
