## Agent default

Agent sessions run tests and computationally intensive validation remotely
through Crabbox. Trusted maintainer code defaults to Blacksmith Testbox. The
configured Testbox workflow hydrates credentials, so untrusted contributor or
fork code must use secretless fork CI or sanitized direct AWS Crabbox instead.

When a trusted code task is likely to need tests or heavy proof, pre-warm
immediately in a background command session, keep working while it hydrates,
reuse the returned `tbx_...` id, sync the current checkout on every run, and
stop it before handoff:

```bash
node scripts/crabbox-wrapper.mjs warmup --provider blacksmith-testbox --keep --timing-json
```

Local test commands below are for human workflows or an explicit agent fallback
requested by the user. Remote-provider unavailability must be reported; it is
not permission to silently run a broad local gate.

For untrusted code, pre-warm with `--provider aws`. Every run must set
`CRABBOX_ENV_ALLOW=CI`, pass `--provider aws --no-hydrate`, and use
a fresh temporary remote `HOME` before installing dependencies or running
tests. Use a newly warmed lease dedicated to that untrusted source; never reuse
a trusted or previously hydrated lease. Launch an installed trusted Crabbox
binary from a clean trusted `main` checkout and fetch only the remote PR with
`--fresh-pr`; never execute the untrusted checkout's wrapper or config locally.
Unset `CRABBOX_AWS_INSTANCE_PROFILE` and fail closed unless resolved
`aws.instanceProfile` is empty. Before any install/test, use trusted
absolute-path tools to require an IMDSv2 token, prove the IAM credentials
endpoint returns 404, and verify remote `git rev-parse HEAD` equals the full
reviewed PR head SHA. Bind the lease to that SHA and stop/rewarm when the head
changes. Upload trusted `scripts/crabbox-untrusted-bootstrap.sh` from clean
`main` alongside `--fresh-pr`; it installs pinned Node/pnpm, verifies the SHA
and package-manager pin, isolates `HOME`, installs dependencies, then executes
the requested test. If the broker cannot prove no role or no remote PR exists,
use secretless fork CI. Do not use `hydrate-github`, `--no-sync`, or a
credential-hydrated Testbox workflow.
Unset all `CRABBOX_TAILSCALE*` overrides, force `--network public
--tailscale=false`, clear exit-node/LAN flags, and require `crabbox inspect` to
report public networking with no Tailscale state before uploading any script.

## Routine local order

1. `pnpm test:changed` for changed-scope Vitest proof.
2. `pnpm test <path-or-filter>` for one file, directory, or explicit target.
3. `pnpm test` only when you intentionally need the full local Vitest suite.

In a Codex worktree or linked/sparse checkout, agents avoid direct local
`pnpm test*` / `pnpm check*` / `pnpm crabbox:run`:

- Explicit user-requested local fallback for a tiny file:
  `node scripts/run-vitest.mjs <path-or-filter>`.
- Changed gates or broad proof: `node scripts/crabbox-wrapper.mjs run --provider blacksmith-testbox ... -- env OPENCLAW_CHECK_CHANGED_REMOTE_CHILD=1 OPENCLAW_CHANGED_LANES_RAW_SYNC=1 corepack pnpm check:changed` so pnpm runs inside Testbox.
- The wrapper's final `exitCode` and timing JSON are the command result. A delegated Blacksmith GitHub Actions run may show `cancelled` after a successful SSH command because the Testbox is stopped from outside the keepalive action; check the wrapper summary and command output before treating that as a failure.
- `OPENCLAW_HEAVY_CHECK_LOCK_SCOPE=worktree <local-heavy-check command>`: keeps heavy-check serialization inside the current worktree instead of the Git common dir for commands such as `pnpm check:changed` and targeted `pnpm test ...`. Use it only on high-capacity local hosts when you intentionally run independent checks across linked worktrees.

## Core commands

Test wrapper runs end with a short `[test] passed|failed|skipped ... in ...` summary; Vitest's own duration line stays the per-shard detail.

| Command                                           | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm test`                                       | Explicit file/directory targets route through scoped Vitest lanes. Untargeted runs are full-suite proof: fixed shard groups expand to leaf configs for local parallel execution, with the expected shard fanout printed before starting. The extension group always expands to per-extension shard configs instead of one giant root-project process. |
| `pnpm test:changed`                               | Cheap smart changed-test run: precise targets from direct test edits, sibling `*.test.ts` files, explicit source mappings, and the local import graph. Broad/config/package changes are skipped unless they map to precise tests.                                                                                                                     |
| `OPENCLAW_TEST_CHANGED_BROAD=1 pnpm test:changed` | Explicit broad changed-test run; use when a test harness/config/package edit should fall back to Vitest's broader changed-test behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `pnpm test:force`                                 | Frees the configured OpenClaw gateway port (default `18789`), then runs the full suite with an isolated gateway port so server tests do not collide with a running instance.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pnpm test:coverage`                              | Unit suite with V8 coverage (`vitest.unit.config.ts`). Default-unit-lane gate, not whole-repo coverage: `coverage.all` is `false` and thresholds are lines/functions/statements 70%, branches 55%, scoped to non-fast unit tests with sibling source files.                                                                                           |
| `pnpm test:coverage:changed`                      | Unit coverage only for files changed since `origin/main`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pnpm changed:lanes`                              | Shows the architectural lanes triggered by the diff against `origin/main`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `pnpm check:changed`                              | Delegates to Crabbox/Testbox by default outside CI, then runs the smart changed check gate inside the remote child: typecheck, lint, and guard commands for affected lanes. Does not run Vitest; use `pnpm test:changed` or `pnpm test <target>` for test proof.                                                                                      |

## Shared test state and process helpers

- `src/test-utils/openclaw-test-state.ts`: use from Vitest when a test needs an isolated `HOME`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, config fixture, workspace, agent dir, or auth-profile store.
- `pnpm test:env-mutations:report`: non-blocking report of tests/harnesses that mutate `HOME`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR`, or related env keys directly. Use it to find migration candidates for the shared test-state helper.
- `test/helpers/openclaw-test-instance.ts`: process-level E2E tests needing a running Gateway, CLI env, log capture, and cleanup in one place.
- Docker/Bash E2E lanes that source `scripts/lib/docker-e2e-image.sh` can pass `docker_e2e_test_state_shell_b64 <label> <scenario>` into the container and decode it with `scripts/lib/openclaw-e2e-instance.sh`; multi-home scripts can pass `docker_e2e_test_state_function_b64` and call `openclaw_test_state_create <label> <scenario>` in each flow. `node scripts/lib/openclaw-test-state.mjs -- create --label <name> --scenario <name> --env-file <path> --json` writes a sourceable host env file (the `--` before `create` keeps newer Node runtimes from treating `--env-file` as a Node flag). Lanes that launch a Gateway can source `scripts/lib/openclaw-e2e-instance.sh` for entrypoint resolution, mock OpenAI startup, foreground/background launch, readiness probes, state env export, log dumps, and process cleanup.

## Control UI, TUI, and extension lanes

- **Control UI mocked E2E:** `pnpm test:ui:e2e` runs the Vitest + Playwright lane that starts the Vite Control UI and drives a real Chromium page against a mocked Gateway WebSocket. Tests live in `ui/src/**/*.e2e.test.ts`; shared mocks/controls live in `ui/src/test-helpers/control-ui-e2e.ts`. `pnpm test:e2e` includes this lane. Agent runs default to Testbox/Crabbox, including targeted proof; use `node scripts/run-vitest.mjs run --config test/vitest/vitest.ui-e2e.config.ts --configLoader runner ui/src/ui/e2e/chat-flow.e2e.test.ts` only for an explicit local fallback.
- **TUI PTY tests:** `node scripts/run-vitest.mjs run --config test/vitest/vitest.tui-pty.config.ts` runs the fast fake-backend PTY lane. `OPENCLAW_TUI_PTY_INCLUDE_LOCAL=1` or `pnpm tui:pty:test:watch --mode local` runs the slower `tui --local` smoke, which mocks only the external model endpoint. Assert stable visible text or fixture calls, not raw ANSI snapshots.
- `pnpm test:extensions` and `pnpm test extensions` run all extension/plugin shards. Heavy channel plugins, the browser plugin, and OpenAI run as dedicated shards; other plugin groups stay batched. `pnpm test extensions/<id>` runs one bundled plugin lane.
- Source files with sibling tests map to that sibling before falling back to wider directory globs. Helper edits under `src/channels/plugins/contracts/test-helpers`, `src/plugin-sdk/test-helpers`, and `src/plugins/contracts` use a local import graph to run importing tests instead of broad-running every shard when the dependency path is precise.
- `auto-reply` splits into three dedicated configs (`core`, `top-level`, `reply`) so the reply harness does not dominate the lighter top-level status/token/helper tests.
- Selected `plugin-sdk` and `commands` test files route through dedicated light lanes that keep only `test/setup.ts`, leaving runtime-heavy cases on their existing lanes.
- Base Vitest config defaults to `pool: "threads"` and `isolate: false`, with the shared non-isolated runner enabled across repo configs.
- `pnpm test:channels` runs `vitest.channels.config.ts`.

## Gateway and E2E

- Gateway integration is opt-in: `OPENCLAW_TEST_INCLUDE_GATEWAY=1 pnpm test` or `pnpm test:gateway`.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: repo E2E aggregate = `pnpm test:e2e:gateway && pnpm test:ui:e2e`.
- `pnpm test:e2e:gateway`: gateway end-to-end smoke tests (multi-instance WS/HTTP/node pairing). Defaults to `threads` + `isolate: false` with adaptive workers in `vitest.e2e.config.ts`; tune with `OPENCLAW_E2E_WORKERS=<n>`, verbose logs with `OPENCLAW_E2E_VERBOSE=1`.
- `pnpm test:live`: provider live tests (Claude/Minimax/DeepSeek/z.ai/etc, gated by `*.live.test.ts`). Requires API keys and `LIVE=1` (or `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1`) to unskip; verbose output with `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=0`.

## Full Docker suite (`pnpm test:docker:all`)

Builds the shared live-test image, packs OpenClaw once as an npm tarball, builds/reuses a bare Node/Git runner image plus a functional image that installs that tarball into `/app`, then runs Docker smoke lanes through a weighted scheduler. `scripts/package-openclaw-for-docker.mjs` is the single local/CI package packer and validates the tarball plus `dist/postinstall-inventory.json` before Docker consumes it.

- Bare image (`OPENCLAW_DOCKER_E2E_BARE_IMAGE`): installer/update/plugin-dependency lanes; mounts the prebuilt tarball instead of copied repo sources.
- Functional image (`OPENCLAW_DOCKER_E2E_FUNCTIONAL_IMAGE`): normal built-app functionality lanes.
- Lane definitions: `scripts/lib/docker-e2e-scenarios.mjs`. Planner: `scripts/lib/docker-e2e-plan.mjs`. Executor: `scripts/test-docker-all.mjs`.
- `node scripts/test-docker-all.mjs --plan-json` emits the scheduler-owned CI plan (lanes, image kinds, package/live-image needs, state scenarios, credential checks) without building or running Docker.

Env var pattern for resource caps is `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_<RESOURCE>_LIMIT` (resource name uppercased, non-alphanumerics collapsed to `_`).

Other behavior: the runner preflights Docker by default, cleans stale OpenClaw E2E containers, shares provider CLI tool caches between compatible lanes, and stops scheduling new pooled lanes after the first failure unless `OPENCLAW_DOCKER_ALL_FAIL_FAST=0` is set. If one lane exceeds the effective weight/resource cap on a low-parallelism host, it can still start from an empty pool and run alone until it releases capacity. Per-lane logs, `summary.json`, `failures.json`, and phase timings write under `.artifacts/docker-tests/<run-id>/`; use `pnpm test:docker:timings <summary.json>` to inspect slow lanes and `pnpm test:docker:rerun <run-id|summary.json|failures.json>` to print cheap targeted rerun commands.

## Local PR gate

For local PR land/gate checks, run:

- `pnpm check:changed`
- `pnpm check`
- `pnpm check:test-types`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm check:docs`

If `pnpm test` flakes on a loaded host, rerun once before treating it as a regression, then isolate with `pnpm test <path/to/test>`. For memory-constrained hosts:

- `OPENCLAW_VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=1 pnpm test`
- `OPENCLAW_VITEST_FS_MODULE_CACHE_PATH=/tmp/openclaw-vitest-cache pnpm test:changed`

## Test performance tooling

- `pnpm test:perf:imports`: enables Vitest import-duration + import-breakdown reporting, while still using scoped lane routing for explicit file/directory targets. `pnpm test:perf:imports:changed` scopes the same profiling to files changed since `origin/main`.
- `pnpm test:perf:changed:bench -- --ref <git-ref>` benchmarks the routed changed-mode path against the native root-project run for the same committed git diff; `pnpm test:perf:changed:bench -- --worktree` benchmarks the current worktree change set without committing first.
- `pnpm test:perf:profile:main` writes a CPU profile for the Vitest main thread (`.artifacts/vitest-main-profile`); `pnpm test:perf:profile:runner` writes CPU + heap profiles for the unit runner (`.artifacts/vitest-runner-profile`).
- `pnpm test:perf:groups --full-suite --allow-failures --output .artifacts/test-perf/baseline-before.json`: runs every full-suite Vitest leaf config serially and writes grouped duration data plus per-config JSON/log artifacts. Full-suite reports isolate files by default so retained module graphs and GC pauses from earlier files are not charged to later assertions; pass `-- --no-isolate` only when intentionally profiling shared-worker accumulation. The Test Performance Agent uses this as its baseline before attempting slow-test fixes. `pnpm test:perf:groups:compare .artifacts/test-perf/baseline-before.json .artifacts/test-perf/after-agent.json` compares grouped reports after a performance-focused change.
- Full, extension, and include-pattern shard runs update local timing data in `.artifacts/vitest-shard-timings.json`; later whole-config runs use those timings to balance slow and fast shards. Include-pattern CI shards append the shard name to the timing key, which keeps filtered shard timings visible without replacing whole-config timing data. Set `OPENCLAW_TEST_PROJECTS_TIMINGS=0` to ignore the local timing artifact.

## Benchmarks

<Accordion title="Model latency (scripts/bench-model.ts)">

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-model.ts --runs 10
```

Optional env: `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`, `MINIMAX_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Default prompt: "Reply with a single word: ok. No punctuation or extra text."

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CLI startup (scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts)">

```bash
pnpm test:startup:bench
pnpm test:startup:bench:smoke
pnpm test:startup:bench:save
pnpm test:startup:bench:update
pnpm test:startup:bench:check
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts --runs 12
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts --preset real --case status --case gatewayStatus --runs 3
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts --entry openclaw.mjs --entry-secondary dist/entry.js --preset all
```

Presets:

- `startup`: `--version`, `--help`, `health`, `health --json`, `status --json`, `status`
- `real`: `health`, `status`, `status --json`, `sessions`, `sessions --json`, `tasks --json`, `tasks list --json`, `tasks audit --json`, `agents list --json`, `gateway status`, `gateway status --json`, `gateway health --json`, `config get gateway.port`
- `all`: both presets combined

Output includes `sampleCount`, avg, p50, p95, min/max, exit-code/signal distribution, and max RSS per command. `--cpu-prof-dir` / `--heap-prof-dir` write V8 profiles per run.

Saved output: `pnpm test:startup:bench:smoke` writes `.artifacts/cli-startup-bench-smoke.json`; `pnpm test:startup:bench:save` writes `.artifacts/cli-startup-bench-all.json` (`runs=5 warmup=1`). Checked-in fixture: `test/fixtures/cli-startup-bench.json`, refreshed by `pnpm test:startup:bench:update`, compared by `pnpm test:startup:bench:check`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Gateway startup (scripts/bench-gateway-startup.ts)">

Defaults to the built CLI entry at `dist/entry.js`; run `pnpm build` first. Pass `--entry scripts/run-node.mjs` to measure the source runner instead, and keep those results separate from built-entry baselines.

```bash
pnpm test:startup:gateway -- --runs 5 --warmup 1
pnpm test:startup:gateway -- --case skipChannels --case fiftyPlugins --runs 5
node --import tsx scripts/bench-gateway-startup.ts --case default --runs 5 --output .artifacts/gateway-startup.json
```

Case ids: `default`, `skipChannels` (channel startup skipped), `oneInternalHook`, `allInternalHooks`, `fiftyPlugins` (50 manifest plugins), `fiftyStartupLazyPlugins` (50 startup-lazy manifest plugins).

Output includes first process output, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, HTTP listen log time, Gateway ready log time, CPU time, CPU core ratio, max RSS, heap, startup trace metrics, event-loop delay, and plugin lookup-table detail metrics. The script sets `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_STARTUP_TRACE=1` in the child Gateway environment.

`/healthz` is liveness (HTTP server can answer). `/readyz` is usable readiness (startup plugin sidecars, channels, and ready-critical post-attach work have settled). Startup hooks dispatch asynchronously and are not part of the readiness guarantee. Ready log time is the Gateway's internal timestamp, useful for process-side attribution but not a substitute for the external `/readyz` probe.

Use JSON output or `--output` when comparing changes. Use `--cpu-prof-dir` only after trace output points at import, compile, or CPU-bound work that phase timings alone cannot explain.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Gateway restart (scripts/bench-gateway-restart.ts)">

macOS and Linux only (uses SIGUSR1 for in-process restarts; fails immediately on Windows). Same built-entry default and `--entry scripts/run-node.mjs` override as gateway startup above.

```bash
pnpm test:restart:gateway -- --case skipChannels --runs 1 --restarts 5
pnpm test:restart:gateway -- --case default --runs 3 --restarts 3 --warmup 1
```

Case ids: `skipChannels`, `skipChannelsAcpxProbe` (ACPX startup probe on), `skipChannelsNoAcpxProbe` (probe off), `default`, `fiftyPlugins`.

Output includes next `/healthz`, next `/readyz`, downtime, restart ready timing, CPU, RSS, startup trace metrics for the replacement process, and restart trace metrics for signal handling, active-work drain, close phases, next start, ready timing, and memory snapshots. The script sets `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_STARTUP_TRACE=1` and `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_RESTART_TRACE=1`.

Use this benchmark when a change touches restart signaling, close handlers, startup-after-restart, sidecar shutdown, service handoff, or readiness after restart. Start with `skipChannels` to isolate Gateway mechanics from channel startup; use `default` or plugin-heavy cases only after the narrow case explains the restart path. Trace metrics are attribution hints, not verdicts — judge a restart change from multiple samples, the matching owner span, `/healthz`/`/readyz` behavior, and the user-visible restart contract.

</Accordion>

## Onboarding E2E (Docker)

Optional; only needed for containerized onboarding smoke tests. Full cold-start flow in a clean Linux container:

```bash
scripts/e2e/onboard-docker.sh
```

Drives the interactive wizard via a pseudo-tty, verifies config/workspace/session files, then starts the gateway and runs `openclaw health`.

## QR import smoke (Docker)

Ensures the maintained QR runtime helper loads under the supported Docker Node runtimes (Node 24 default, Node 22 compatible):

```bash
pnpm test:docker:qr
```
